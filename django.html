          <h1>Django</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is a widely-used Python web 
application framework with a "batteries-included" philosophy. The principle
behind batteries-included is that the common functionality for building
web applications should come with the framework instead of as separate
libraries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/django-logo-positive.png" width="100%" alt="Official Django logo. Trademark Django Software Foundation." class="technical-diagram" /></a></p>
<p>For example, 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/">authentication</a>,
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/">URL routing</a>, a 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/">templating system</a>,
an <a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapper</a> (ORM),
and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/">database schema migrations</a>
(as of version 1.7) are all included with the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/">Django framework</a>. 
Compare that included functionality to the Flask framework which requires a 
separate library such as 
<a href="https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Flask-Login</a>
to perform user authentication. </p>
<p>The batteries-included and extensibility philosophies are simply two different
ways to tackle framework building. Neither philosophy is inherently better 
than the other one.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Django is an implementation of the <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> concept. Learn how these pieces fit together in the <a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Why is Django a good web framework choice?</h2>
<p>The Django project's stability, performance and community have grown 
tremendously over the past decade since the framework's creation. Detailed
tutorials and good practices are readily available on the web and in books.
The framework continues to add significant new functionality such as 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/">database migrations</a>
with each release. </p>
<p>I highly recommend the Django framework as a starting place for new Python web 
developers because the official documentation and tutorials are some of the 
best anywhere in software development. Many cities also have Django-specific
groups such as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/django-district/">Django District</a>,
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/">Django Boston</a> and 
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-San-Francisco-Django-Meetup-Group/">San Francisco Django</a> 
so new developers can get help when they are stuck.</p>
<p>There's some debate on whether 
<a href="http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/12/11/learning-python-via-django-considered-harmful/">learning Python by using Django is a bad idea</a>. 
However, that criticism is invalid if you take the time to learn the Python
syntax and language semantics first before diving into web development.</p>
<h2>Django books and tutorials</h2>
<p>There are a slew of free or low cost resources out there for Django. Since
Django was released over 10 years ago and has had a huge number of updates
since then, when you're looking for an up-to-date Django book check out the
list below or read this post showing <a href="http://twoscoopspress.org/pages/current-django-books">current Django books</a>
as of Django 1.7.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/">Test-Driven Development with Python</a> 
  focuses on web development using Django and JavaScript. This book uses 
  the development of a website using the Django web framework as a real
  world example of how to perform test-driven development (TDD). There is
  also coverage of NoSQL, websockets and asynchronous responses. The book can
  be read online for free or purchased in hard copy via O'Reilly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/">Tango with Django</a> is an extensive 
  set of free introductions to using the most popular Python web framework. 
  Several current developers said this book really helped them get over the 
  initial framework learning curve. It's recently been updated for Django 1.7!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html">Django Girls Tutorial</a>
  is a great tutorial that doesn't assume any prior knowledge of Python or
  Django while helping you build your first web application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8">2 Scoops of Django</a>

  to the web framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/django">Django subreddit</a> often has links to
