meta: Nginx is a commonly deployed web server that also functions well as a reverse proxy for WSGI Python web apps.


[Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/), pronounced "engine-X", is the 
[second most common web server among the top 100,000 websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/web_server/ranking). Nginx also functions well as a 
reverse proxy to handle requests and pass back responses for Python 
[WSGI servers](/wsgi-servers.html) or even other web servers such as Apache.

## How is Nginx used in a Python web app deployment?
Nginx is commonly used as a web server to serve static assets such 
as images, CSS and JavaScript to web browser clients. 

Nginx is also typically configured as a reverse proxy, which passes 
appropriate incoming HTTP requests to a [WSGI server](/wsgi-servers.html).
The WSGI server produces dynamic content by running Python code. When the 
WSGI server passes its response, which is often in the HTML, JSON or XML 
format, the reverse proxy then responds to the client with that result. 

The request and response cycle with a reverse proxy server and the WSGI
server can be seen in the following diagram.

Typically the client will not know or need to know that a Python web 
application generated the result. The result could have instead been 
generated by one or more backend systems written in any programming language,
not just Python.

## Should I use Nginx or the Apache HTTP Server?
Let's be clear about these two "competing" servers: they are both fantastic
open source projects and either will serve your web application deployment 
well. In fact, many of the top global web applications use both servers in
their deployments to function in many steps throughout the HTTP 
request-response cycle.

I personally use Nginx more frequently than Apache because Nginx's 
configuration feel easier to write, with less boilerplate than alternatives.

There's also a bit of laziness in the usage: Nginx works well, it never causes
me problems. So I stick with my battle-tested 
Ansible [configuration management](/configuration-management.html) files
that set up Nginx with HTTPS and SSL/TLS certificates 


## Securing Nginx
Nginx's default configuration after a standard installation through a
system package manager or compiling from source is a good base for security.
However, setting up ciphers and redirects can be confusing the first few
times you try it. It's a really good idea to read some of these tutorials
to make sure you are avoiding the most common security errors that plague
HTTP(S) configurations.

* [HTTPS with Let's Encrypt and nginx](https://botleg.com/stories/https-with-lets-encrypt-and-nginx/)
  walks throough installing a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
  to secure HTTP connects to your nginx server via HTTPS.

* The [Nginx Config](https://nginxconfig.io/) tool can generate strong 
  encryption configurations and ciphers for Nginx.

* [Gixy](https://github.com/yandex/gixy) is a static analyzer for your
  Nginx configuration and can tell you issues with how you are setup.

* [Strong SSL Security on Nginx](https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html)
  shows how to mitigate high profile SSL attacks like 
  [Logjam](https://weakdh.org/),
  [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/)
  and [FREAK](https://freakattack.com/).


## Specific Nginx resources
Nginx can be used without Python so there are a massive number of fantastic
resources available for installing, configuring and optimizing this 
[web server](/web-servers.html) implementation. The following resources are
ones that I collected during my own struggle while learning how to use 
Nginx after I had used [Apache HTTP Server](/apache-http-server.html) for 
several years.

* The [Nginx chapter](http://www.aosabook.org/en/nginx.html) in the
  [Architecture of Open Source Applications book](http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html)
  has a great chapter devoted to why Nginx is built to scale a certain way
  and lessons learned along the development journey.

* [nginx-quick-reference](https://github.com/trimstray/nginx-quick-reference)
  provides fantastic tactical advice for improving Nginx performance,
  handling security and many other critical aspects.

* [Inside Nginx: How we designed for performance and scale](http://nginx.com/blog/inside-nginx-how-we-designed-for-performance-scale/)
  is a blog post from the developers behind Nginx on why they believe their
  architecture model is more performant and scalable than other approaches
  used to build web servers.

* [Test-driving web server configuration](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/25/test-driving-web-server-configuration/)
  tells a good story for how to iteratively apply configuration changes, such
  as routing traffic to [Piwik](http://piwik.org/) for 
  [web analytics](/web-analytics.html), reverse proxying to backend
  application servers and terminately TLS connections appropriately.
  It is impressive to read a well-written softare development article like
  this from a government agency, although UK's Government Digital Service as
  well as USA's 18F and US Digital Service foster a far more credible
  culture than most typical agencies.

* [Hacker News broke our site – how Nginx and PageSpeed fixed the problem](https://www.airport-parking-shop.co.uk/blog/hacker-news-broke-site-nginx-pagespeed-fixed-problem/)
  is primarily about optimizing Nginx's configuration for more efficient 
  SSL connections. The post also covers 
  [configuration management](/configuration-management.html) with Ansible
  as well as the Pagespeed module that Google released for both Nginx
  and the [Apache HTTP Server](/apache-http-server.html).

* [Nginx for Developers: An Introduction](http://carrot.is/coding/nginx_introduction)
  provides the first steps to getting an initial Nginx configuration up and
  running. 

* [A faster Web server: ripping out Apache for Nginx](http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/11/a-faster-web-server-ripping-out-apache-for-nginx/)
  explains how Nginx can be used instead of Apache in some cases for
  better performance.

* [Nginx vs Apache: Our view](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-vs-apache-our-view/)
  is a first-party perspective written by the developers behind Nginx
  as to the differences between the web servers.

* [Rate Limiting with Nginx](http://lincolnloop.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/)
  covers how to mitigate against brute force password guessing attempts using
  Nginx rate limits.

* [Nginx with dynamic upstreams](http://tenzer.dk/nginx-with-dynamic-upstreams/)
  is an important note for setting up your upstream WSGI server(s) if you're
  using Nginx as a reverse proxy with hostnames that change.

* [Nginx Caching](https://serversforhackers.com/nginx-caching/) shows how
  to set up Nginx for caching HTTP requests, which is often done by Varnish
  but can also be handled by Nginx with the `proxy_cache` and related
  directives.

* [Dynamic log formats in nginx](https://benwilber.github.io/nginx/syslog/logging/2015/08/26/dynamic-log-formats-in-nginx.html) 
  explains how to use the HttpSetMiscModule module to transform variables
  in Nginx and map input to controlled output in the logs. The author uses
  this technique for pixel tracking but there are other purposes this method
  could be used for such as advanced debugging. 

* [Detecting Bots in Apache & Nginx Logs](http://tech.marksblogg.com/detect-bots-apache-nginx-logs.html)
  is an awesome tutorial that shows how to filter web crawlers and bots
  from your traffic logs when using them for web traffic analytics.
