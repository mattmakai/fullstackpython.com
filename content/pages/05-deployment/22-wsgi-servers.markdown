A [Web Server Gateway Interface](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
(WSGI) server implements the web server side of the WSGI interface for
running Python web applications. 


## Why is WSGI necessary?
A traditional web server does not understand or have any way to run Python 
applications. In the late 1990s, a developer named Grisha Trubetskoy 
[came up with an Apache module called mod\_python](http://grisha.org/blog/2013/10/25/mod-python-the-long-story/) 
to execute arbitrary Python code. For several years in the late 1990s 
and early 2000s, Apache configured with mod\_python ran most Python web 
applications.

However, mod\_python wasn't a standard specification. It was just an 
implementation that allowed Python code to run on a server. As mod\_python's 
development stalled and security vulnerabilities were discovered there 
was recognition by the community that a consistent way to execute Python 
code for web applications was needed.

Therefore the Python community came up with WSGI as a standard interface that
modules and containers could implement. WSGI is now the accepted approach 
for running Python web applications.

As shown in the above diagram, a WSGI server simply invokes a callable object
on the WSGI application as defined by the PEP 3333 standard.


## WSGI's Purpose
Why use WSGI and not just point a web server directly at an application?

* **WSGI gives you flexibility**. Application developers can swap out
  web stack components for others. For example, a developer can switch from 
  Green Unicorn to uWSGI without modifying the application or framework 
  that implements WSGI. 
  From [PEP 3333](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/):

    The availability and widespread use of such an API in web servers for 
    Python [...] would separate choice of framework from choice of web 
    server, freeing users to choose a pairing that suits them, while 
    freeing framework and server developers to focus on their preferred 
    area of specialization.

* **WSGI servers promote scaling**. Serving thousands of requests for dynamic
  content at once is the domain of WSGI servers, not frameworks.
  WSGI servers handle processing requests from the web server and deciding
  how to communicate those requests to an application framework's process.
  The segregation of responsibilities is important for efficiently scaling 
  web traffic.

WSGI is by design a simple standard interface for running Python code. As
a web developer you won't need to know much more than

* what WSGI stands for (Web Server Gateway Inteface)

* that a WSGI container is a separate running process that runs on a
  different port than your web server

* your web server is configured to pass requests to the WSGI container which
  runs your web application, then pass the response (in the form of HTML)
  back to the requester

If you're using a standard web framework such as Django, Flask, or
Bottle, or almost any other current Python framework, you don't need to worry
about how frameworks implement the application side of the WSGI standard.
Likewise, if you're using a standard WSGI container such as Green Unicorn,
uWSGI, mod\_wsgi, or gevent, you can get them running without worrying about
how they implement the WSGI standard.

However, knowing the WSGI standard and how these frameworks and containers
implement WSGI should be on your learning checklist though as you become
a more experienced Python web developer.


## Official WSGI specifications
The WSGI standard v1.0 is specified in
[PEP 0333](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/). As of September 2010,
WSGI v1.0 is superseded by
[PEP 3333](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/), which defines the
v1.0.1 WSGI standard. If you're working with Python 2.x and you're compliant
with PEP 0333, then you're also compliant with 3333. The newer version is
simply an update for Python 3 and has instructions for how unicode should
be handled.

[wsgiref in Python 2.x](https://docs.python.org/2/library/wsgiref.html) and
[wsgiref in Python 3.x](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/wsgiref.html)
are the reference implementations of the WSGI specification built into
Python's standard library so it can be used to build WSGI servers and
applications.


## Example web server configuration
A web server's configuration specifies what requests should be passed to
the WSGI server to process. Once a request is processed and generated by the
WSGI server, the response is passed back through the web server and onto
the browser. 

For example, this Nginx web server's configuration specifies that
Nginx should handle static assets (such as images, JavaScript, and CSS
files) under the /static directory and pass all other requests to the WSGI
server running on port 8000:

    # this specifies that there is a WSGI server running on port 8000
    upstream app_server_djangoapp {
        server localhost:8000 fail_timeout=0;
    }

    # Nginx is set up to run on the standard HTTP port and listen for requests
    server {
      listen 80;

      # nginx should serve up static files and never send to the WSGI server
      location /static {
        autoindex on;
        alias /srv/www/assets;
      }

      # requests that do not fall under /static are passed on to the WSGI
      # server that was specified above running on port 8000
      location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_redirect off;

        if (!-f $request_filename) {
          proxy_pass http://app_server_djangoapp;
          break;
        }
      }
    }

Note that the above code is a simplified version of a production-ready Nginx
configuration. For real SSL and non-SSL templates, take a look at the
[Underwear web server templates](https://github.com/mattmakai/underwear/tree/master/underwear/roles/web/templates) on GitHub.


## WSGI server implementations
There is a comprehensive list of WSGI servers on the 
[WSGI Read the Docs](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/servers.html) page.
The following are WSGI servers based on community recommendations.

* [Green Unicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) is a pre-fork worker model based
  server ported from the Ruby [Unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) project.

* [uWSGI](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is gaining steam as
  a highly-performant WSGI server implementation.

* [mod\_wsgi](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi) is an Apache 
  module implementing the WSGI specification.

* [CherryPy](https://github.com/cherrypy/cherrypy) is a pure Python web 
  server that also functions as a WSGI server.

  and
  [PEP 3333 WSGI v1.0.1](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/)
  specifications.

* This [basics of WSGI](http://agiliq.com/blog/2013/07/basics-wsgi/) post
  contains a simple example of how a WSGI-compatible application works.

* [A comparison of web servers for Python web apps](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-comparison-of-web-servers-for-python-based-web-applications)
  is a good read to understand basic information about various WSGI server
  implementations.

* A thorough and informative post for LAMP-stack hosting choices is 
  presented in the 
  "[complete single server Django stack tutorial](http://www.apreche.net/complete-single-server-django-stack-tutorial/)." 

* The Python community made a long effort to 
  [transition from mod\_python](http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2010/05/modpython-project-soon-to-be-officially.html) 
  to the WSGI standard. That transition period is now complete and an 
  implementation of WSGI should always be used instead mod\_python.

* [How to Deploy Python WSGI Applications with CherryPy](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-deploy-python-wsgi-applications-using-a-cherrypy-web-server-behind-nginx)
  answers why CherryPy is a simple combination web and WSGI server along with 
  how to use it.

* Another Digital Ocean walkthrough goes into
  [How to Deploy Python WSGI Apps Using Gunicorn HTTP Server Behind Nginx](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-python-wsgi-apps-using-gunicorn-http-server-behind-nginx).

* [The uWSGI Swiss Army Knife](https://lincolnloop.com/blog/uwsgi-swiss-army-knife/)
  shows how uWSGI can potentially be used for more than just running the
  Python web application - it can also serve static files and handle
  caching in a deployment.


## WSGI servers learning checklist
1. Understand that WSGI is a standard Python specification for applications 
   and servers to implement. 

1. Pick a WSGI server based on available documentation and tutorials. Green 
   Unicorn is a good one to start with since it's been around for awhile.

1. Add the WSGI server to your server deployment.

1. Configure the web server to pass requests to the WSGI server for 
   appropriate URL patterns.

1. Test that the WSGI server responds to local requests but not direct 
   requests outside your infrastructure. The web server should be the pass 
   through for requests to and responses from the WSGI server.
