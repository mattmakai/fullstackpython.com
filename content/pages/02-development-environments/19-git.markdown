meta: Git is an implementation of the source (version) control concept. Learn more about Git and source control on Full Stack Python.


[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed open source 
[source control](/source-control.html) (also referred to as "version 
control") system commonly used to track and manage file changes. Git is 
frequently used as the version control system for Python projects.

## Why is Git widely-used by developers?
Git is a *distributed* version control system (DVCS) compared to the 
centralized models previously provided by 
[Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) and [CVS](https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/).
Files would need to be "checked out" over the network by a single person at
a time while she was working. The network transfer speed as well as the 
blocking check out model became a significant bottleneck, especially for 
large development teams. 

Git clones a full repository and its entire history instead of just the 
current state of a file. Developers only require a network connection when
pulling updates and pushing changes to a backup repository. The commit log
and file histories are stored and transmitted far more efficiently than
prior version control systems to maximize the effectiveness of the 
distributed version control design.

Another issue with traditional VCS was that it was difficult to create 
branches. Take a look
[at this tutorial on managing a CVS repository](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~macleod/docs/cvs-tips.html)
as an example of the confusion the existing non-distributed models could
cause. Git simplified the branching process with simplified commands 
such as `git checkout -b` and faster branch merging and clean up. In contrast
to earlier version control systems, Git encourages developers to create local 
branches and experiment in them without impacting a stable `master` branch.

[GitHub](https://www.github.com/) also helped to drive Git as the overwhelming
version control favorite by providing the open source community with free open
remote Git repositories. GitHub's web application user interface, issue 
tracking and pull request features for maintainers and consumers also 
encouraged more collaboration than Git alone. Recently, 
[GitHub's third-party marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) has
begun to add more features by integrating 
[continuous integration](/continuous-integration.html) servers like 
as [Jenkins](/jenkins.html) and [code metrics](/code-metrics.html) services.

## Advanced Git tutorials and resources
You won't learn Git in an afternoon or even a few months of usage. After
six-plus years of working with Git I still get tripped up and have a lot to
learn. These tutorials have taught me some of the beyond-the-basics edge
cases.

* [Flight rules for git](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules)

  commit history, such as which developers are domain experts in certain
  tools, potential hot spots in the code and coupling between source code
  files. This is a great read once you get past the basics of using Git.

* [Write yourself a Git!](https://wyag.thb.lt/) is a tutorial for building 
  your own version of Git from scratch with 503 lines of Python code. The 
  result is obviously not as full-featured as the real Git implementation
  but this program is awesome for understanding how Git's internals work.

  explains that the SHA-1 hash isn't used for security on Git, it's a
  consistency check. [SHA-1 has been broken](https://shattered.io/)
  in practice so Git needs to transition to a stronger hash without proven
  collisions but it's not quite as big of a concern compared to 
  security-related projects that use SHA-1.

  recovering deleted commits, squashing multiple commits into one with 
  interactive rebase and recovering deleted branches.


## Git Workflows
Teams of developers can use Git in varying workflows because of Git's 
distributed model and lightweight branching. There is no "right way" to 
use Git, especially because development teams can range in size from a
single developer up to entire companies with thousands of developers in
a repository. The only correct answer is to let the developers decide on
a workflow that maximizes their ability to frequently commit code and
minimize merge conflicts.

* [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) shows
  one possible way for small teams to use Git branches.
  [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) explains
  why at GitHub they do not use the git-flow model and provides an 
  alternative that solves some of the issues they found with git-flow.
  
* [Git Workflows That Work](http://blog.endpoint.com/2014/05/git-workflows-that-work.html)
  is a helpful post with diagrams to show how teams can create a Git workflow
  that will help their development process.

* [Comparing workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
  provides a slew of examples for how developers on a team can handle merge
  conflicts and other situations that commonly arise when using Git.
