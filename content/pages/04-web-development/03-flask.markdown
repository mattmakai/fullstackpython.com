meta: Flask is a popular, extensible web microframework for building web applications with Python.


[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) ([source code](https://github.com/pallets/flask))
is a Python [web framework](/web-frameworks.html) built with a 
[small core and easy-to-extend philosophy](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/design/).

### Why is Flask a good web framework choice?
Flask is considered more 
[Pythonic](http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html)
than the [Django](/django.html) web framework because in common situations the
equivalent Flask web application is more explicit. Flask is also easy to get 
started with as a beginner because there is little boilerplate code for getting a 
simple app up and running. 

For example, here is a valid "Hello, world!" web application with Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```


The above code shows "Hello, World!" on localhost port 5000 in a web browser 
when run with the `python app.py` command and the Flask library installed.

The equivalent "Hello, World!" web application using the [Django](/django.html)
[web framework](/web-frameworks.html) would involve significantly more boilerplate
code.

Flask was also written several years after Django and therefore
learned from the Python community's reactions as the framework evolved.
Jökull Sólberg wrote a great piece articulating to this effect in his 
[experience switching between Flask and Django](http://web.archive.org/web/20160305145017/http://jokull.calepin.co/my-flask-to-django-experience.html).

### How does Flask relate to the Pallets Projects?
Flask was originally designed and developed by Armin Ronacher as an 
[April Fool's Day joke in 2010](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2010/4/3/april-1st-post-mortem/).
Despite the origin as a joke, the Flask framework became wildly popular as 
an alternative to Django projects with their monolithic structure and 
dependencies.

Flask's success created a lot of additional work in issue tickets and pull 
requests. Armin eventually created 
[The Pallets Projects](https://www.palletsprojects.com/) collection of open
source code libraries after he had been managing Flask under his own GitHub 
account for several years. The Pallets Project now serves as the 
community-driven organization that handles Flask and other related Python
libraries such as [Lektor](/lektor.html), [Jinja](/jinja2.html) and
several others.


### Flask tutorials

to build full-featured web applications with any framework takes a lot of work.

### Open source Flask example projects
Flask's lack of standard boilerplate via a commandline interface for
setting up your project structure is a double edged sword. When you
get started with Flask you will have to figure out how to scale the 
files and modules for the code in your application. The following open 
source projects range from simple to complex and can give you ideas 
about how to working on your codebase.

* [Skylines](https://github.com/skylines-project/skylines) is an open source 
  flight tracking web application built with Flask. You can check out a 
  [running version of the application](https://skylines.aero/).

* [Flask JSONDash](https://github.com/christabor/flask_jsondash) is a Flask
  blueprint that creates JavaScript Object Notiation (JSON) 
  [APIs](/application-programming-interfaces.html) for [data](/data.html)
  dashboards.

* [Microblog](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog) is the companion
  open source project that goes along with Miguel Grinberg's O'Reilly Flask
  book.

* [Flaskr TDD](https://github.com/mjhea0/flaskr-tdd) takes the official Flask
  tutorial and adds test driven development and JQuery to the project. 

* Charles Leifer (author of [Peewee](/peewee.html) and [Pony ORM](/pony-orm.html)) 
  built a 
  [note-taking app](http://charlesleifer.com/blog/saturday-morning-hack-a-little-note-taking-app-with-flask/)
  along with the 
  [source code in Gists](https://gist.github.com/coleifer/632d3c9aa6b2ea519384).

* [Reddit Job Search](https://github.com/anis-coding/Reddit-Job-Search)
  uses the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) for a jobs data set
  and presents them via a Flask web app.

* [Bean Counter](https://github.com/BouncyNudibranch/bean-counter) is an
  open source Flask app for tracking coffee.

* [FlaskBB](https://flaskbb.org/) is a Flask app for a discussion forum.

* [psdash](https://github.com/Jahaja/psdash) is an app built with Flask and
  psutils to display information about the computer it is running on.


### Flask project templates
Flask's wide array of extension libraries comes at the cost of having a more
complicated project setup. The following project templates provide a starter
base that you can either use for your own applications or just learn various
ways to structure your code.

* Use the 
  [Flask App Engine Template](https://github.com/kamalgill/flask-appengine-template)
  for getting set up on Google App Engine with Flask.

* [Flask Foundation](https://github.com/JackStouffer/Flask-Foundation) is a
  starting point for new Flask projects. There's also a 
  [companion website](https://jackstouffer.github.io/Flask-Foundation/) for
  the project that explains what extensions the base project includes.

* [Cookiecutter Flask](https://github.com/cookiecutter-flask/cookiecutter-flask) is a 
  project template for use with 
  [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter).

* [Flask-Boilerplate](https://github.com/MaxHalford/Flask-Boilerplate) 
  provides another starting project with sign up, log in and password
  reset.

* The company Sunscrapers provides this 
  [Flask boilerplate project with SQLAlchemy, py.test and Celery](https://github.com/sunscrapers/flask-boilerplate)
  baked into the Flask project structure.

* [flask-webpack-cookiecutter](https://github.com/mattfinnell/flask-webpack-cookiecutter/)
  combines a Flask framework project structure with 
  [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), a module bundler frequently used
  in the JavaScript world.
    
* [Bootstrap-Flask](https://github.com/helloflask/bootstrap-flask) is a
  collection of Jinja macros for [Bootstrap](/bootstrap-css.html) 4 & 5 and
  Flask. It helps rendering Flask-related data and objects to Bootstrap markup
  HTML more easily. Check the [demo](http://bootstrapflaskdemo5.nsupdate.info/)
  for the versions of Bootstrap it supports.


## Open source code for learning Flask
There are many open source projects that rely on Flask to operate.
One of the best ways to learn how to use this framework is to read
how other projects use it in real-world code. This section lists
these code examples by class and method in Flask.
