meta: Bootstrap is a CSS framework for building website and web application user interfaces.


[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a CSS framework that makes it 
easier to create website and web application user interfaces. Bootstrap 
is especially useful as a base layer of 
[CSS](/cascading-style-sheets.html) to build sites with
[responsive web design](/responsive-design.html).

## Should I use Bootstrap 3 or 4?
[Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) was out for almost five
years before 
[Bootstrap 4](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/01/18/bootstrap-4/) was
finally released at the start of 2018. When learning Bootstrap you will
likely come across many tutorials that cover Bootstrap 3 but not version 4.

If you are completely new to Bootstrap and CSS frameworks in general then
I recommend learning Bootstrap 4. If you have already been working with
Bootstrap 3 then there is no major rush to upgrade to the latest version.
Bootstrap 4 is more complicated than version 3 because it has a lot more
features so the learning curve is a bit steeper.

[Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/) is actually built
with an early version of Bootstrap 3. However, this site is so heavily
customized with my own CSS that I likely will never upgrade to Bootstrap 4
because there are no new features that I feel will be useful in my
specific situation.

In May 2021, Bootstrap 5 has been released. It has many improvements and
additions compared to version 4.
