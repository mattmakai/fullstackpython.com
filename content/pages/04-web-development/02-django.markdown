meta: Learn more about Django, the popular batteries-included Python web framework, on Full Stack Python.


[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) is a widely-used Python web 
application framework with a "batteries-included" philosophy. The principle
behind batteries-included is that the common functionality for building
web applications should come with the framework instead of as separate
libraries.

<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/django.png" width="100%" alt="Official Django logo. Trademark Django Software Foundation." class="shot"></a>

For example, 
[authentication](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/),
[URL routing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/), a 
[template engine](/django-templates.html),
an [object-relational mapper](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html) (ORM),
and [database schema migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/)
are all included with the [Django framework](https://pypi.org/project/Django/). 
Compare that included functionality to the Flask framework which requires a 
separate library such as 
[Flask-Login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
to perform user authentication. 

The batteries-included and extensibility philosophies are simply two different
ways to tackle framework building. Neither philosophy is inherently better 
than the other one.

## Why is Django a good web framework choice?
The Django project's stability, performance and community have grown 
tremendously over the past decade since the framework's creation. Detailed
tutorials and good practices are readily available on the web and in books.
The framework continues to add significant new functionality such as 
[database migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/)
with each release. 

I highly recommend the Django framework as a starting place for new Python web 
developers because the official documentation and tutorials are some of the 
best anywhere in software development. Many cities also have Django-specific
groups such as [Django District](http://www.meetup.com/django-district/),
[Django Boston](http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/) and 
[San Francisco Django](http://www.meetup.com/The-San-Francisco-Django-Meetup-Group/) 
so new developers can get help when they are stuck.


## Django books and tutorials
There are a slew of free or low cost resources out there for Django. Make
sure to check the version numbers used in each post you read because 
Django was released over 10 years ago and has had a huge number of updates
since then. These resources are geared towards beginners. If you are already
experienced with Django you should take a look at the next section of
resources for more advanced tutorials.

* [Tango with Django](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/) is an extensive 
  set of free introductions to using the most popular Python web framework. 
  Several current developers said this book really helped them get over the 
  initial framework learning curve.

## Django Channels
Channels are a new mechanism in Django 1.9 provided as a standalone app. 
They may be incorporated into the core framework in 2.0+. Channels provide 
"real-time" full-duplex communication between the browser and the server 
based on [WebSockets](/websockets.html). 
  
* This 
  [tutorial shows how to get started with Django Channels in your project](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2016/3/17/in_deep_with_django_channels_the_future_of_real_time_apps_in_django).

  client/server communication with Django Channels, control flow and
  routing with Angular, and build a RESTful API with Django REST
  Framework.

## Django testing

### Django with JavaScript MVC frameworks
There are resources for JavaScript MVC frameworks such as
[Angular](/angular.html), [React](/react.html) and [Vue.js](/vuejs.html) 
on their respective pages.


### Django ORM tutorials
Django comes with its own custom object-relational mapper (ORM) typically
referred to as "the Django ORM". Learn more about the 
[Django ORM](/django-orm.html) on the its own page and more broadly about
ORMs on the 
[Python object-relational mappers page](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html).


## Static and media files
Deploying and handling static and media files can be confusing for new
Django developers. These resources along with the 
[static content](/static-content.html) page are useful for figuring out how 
to handle these files properly.

* [Using Amazon S3 to Store your Django Site's Static and Media Files](http://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2014/11/10/Using-Amazon-S3-to-store-your-Django-sites-static-and-media-files/)

  media file serving.

  shows how to configure Django to load and serve up static and media files, public and private, via an Amazon S3 bucket.


## Django project templates
Project templates, not to be confused with a 
[template engine](/template-engines.html), generate boilerplate code for
a base Django project plus optional libraries that are often used when 
developing web applications.

* [Caktus Group's Django project template](https://github.com/caktus/django-project-template) 
  is Django 2.2+ ready.

* [Cookiecutter Django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) is a 
  project template from Daniel Greenfeld, for use with Audrey Roy's 
  [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter). The template results
  are Heroku deployment-ready.

* [Two Scoops Django project template](https://github.com/twoscoops/django-twoscoops-project)
  is also from the PyDanny and Audrey Roy. This one provides a quick scaffold
  described in the Two Scoops of Django book.

* [Sugardough](https://github.com/mozilla/sugardough) is a Django project
  template from Mozilla that is compatible with cookiecutter.


## Open source Django example projects
Reading open source code can be useful when you are trying to figure
out how to build your own projects. This is a short list of some
real-world example applications, and many more can be found on the
[Django example projects and code](/django-code-examples.html) page.

* [Openduty](https://github.com/ustream/openduty) is a website status checking
  and alert system similar to PagerDuty.

  [part 2](https://github.com/phalt/twilio-django-part-2) show you how to
  build a really cool Django application. There's also an accompanying 
  [blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/07/build-an-ivr-system-with-twilio-and-django.html)
  with detailed explanations of each step.

* [Taiga](https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-back) is a project management
  tool built with Django as the backend and AngularJS as the front end.

* [Chowist](https://github.com/huangsam/chowist) is a web application
  that replicates core features of Yelp and adds a couple more bells
  and whistles.


## Open source code to learn Django
There are many open source projects that rely on Django.
One of the best ways to learn how to use this framework is to read
how other projects use it in real-world code. This section lists
these code examples by class and method in Django's code base.
