meta: The core Python programming language includes a combination of features not found in many other languages.


The Python programming language is an 
[open source](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/), 
[widely-used](/why-use-python.html) tool for 
creating software applications.


## What is Python used for?
Python is often used to [build](/web-frameworks.html) and [deploy](/deployment.html) 
[web applications](/web-development.html) and 
[web APIs](/application-programming-interfaces.html). Python
can also analyze and visualize [data](/data.html) 
and [test software](/testing.html), even if the software being
tested was not written in Python.


## Language concepts
Python has several useful programming language concepts that are less 
frequently found in other languages. These concepts include:

* generators
* comprehensions
* [application dependency](/application-dependencies.html) handling via 
  the built-in [venv](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/) 
  ([as of Python 3.3](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html)) and
  [pip](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0453/) 
  ([as of Python 3.4](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html))
  commands


## Generators
Generators are a Python core language construct that allow a function's return
value to behave as an iterator. A generator can allow more efficient 
memory usage by allocating and deallocating memory during the context of a 
large number of iterations. Generators are defined in 
[PEP255](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/) and included in the
language as of Python 2.2 in 2001.


## Comprehensions
Comprehensions are a Python language construct for concisely creating data
in lists, dictionaries and sets. List comprehensions are included in Python 2
while dictionary and set comprehensions were introduced to the language in
Python 3.


## Why are comprehensions important?
Comprehensions are a more clear syntax for populating conditional data in the 
core Python data structures. Creating data without comprehensions often 
involves nested loops with conditionals that can be difficult for code
readers to properly evaluate.


## Example comprehensions code
List comprehension:

    >>> double_digit_evens = [e*2 for e in range(5, 50)]
    >>> double_digit_evens
    [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98]


Set comprehension:

    >>> double_digit_odds = {e*2+1 for e in range(5, 50)}
    {11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99}

Dictionary comprehension:
    
    >>> {e: e*10 for e in range(1, 11)}
    {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60, 7: 70, 8: 80, 9: 90, 10: 100}
