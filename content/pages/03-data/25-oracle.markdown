meta: Oracle Database is an enterprise relational database management system.


[Oracle Database](http://www.oracle.com/) is an enterprise
[relational database](/databases.html). It can run transaction processing, 
data warehousing, and multi-model database workloads such as machine 
learning, spatial, and graph analysis. Recent versions of Oracle Database 
also added support for JSON and blockchain use cases, and the software
can be run in on-premise, cloud or hybrid environments.

## How does Oracle fit with Python?
The Python community and Oracle have a long history. The excellent Python Database API-compliant "cx_Oracle" interface for Oracle Database was first created by the user community in 1998 and is now being enhanced and maintained by Oracle as python-oracledb. The [python-oracledb](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/samples/tutorial/Python-and-Oracle-Database-Scripting-for-the-Future.html) module also underpins the [Oracle Machine Learning for Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P861m__PEMQ) engine. Oracle's high-performance  GraalVM framework supports an implementation of Python called [GraalPython](https://github.com/oracle/graalpython).


## Why is Oracle Database a great choice?
Oracle Database is cross-platform, supporting multiple hardware platforms and various operating systems. Developers and companies of all sizes rely on its proven industry-leading performance, scalability, reliability, and security.
As data volumes rise exponentially, new data types and data models are required to support modern applications. Oracle Database supports the following data types at no extra cost:

*	[JSON](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/adjsn/index.html)
*	[Blockchain](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/nfcon/details-oracle-blockchain-table-282449857.html)
*	[XML](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xmldb.html)
*	[Object](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ADOBJ/adobjint.htm#ADOBJ00101)
*	[Graph](https://www.oracle.com/database/graph/)
*	[Spatial](https://www.oracle.com/database/spatial/)
*	[Time Series](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dmcon/time-series.html)
*	Relational

With support for scale-out database clusters, sharded distributed systems, and disaster recovery with continuous application availability, there is no shortage of features to guarantee the Database continues to run uninterrupted 24/7.   

Oracle makes its enterprise-class database readily available to developers with its free on-premises edition Oracle Database XE or on the Oracle public cloud with an Always Free Cloud account.  In addition, Oracle Autonomous Database is a popular choice for developers as no database management or tuning is required, leaving developers to do what they do best – writing code for their applications.  


## Connecting to Oracle Database with Python
As with any database, applications require a connector or driver to connect to the Oracle Database. The Python DB API-compliant [python-oracledb](https://oracle.github.io/python-oracledb/) interface provides developers access to standard and advanced Oracle Database features, such as SQL execution and document storage APIs.  It also gives users access to network traffic encryption capabilities and Oracle's leading high availability features.

[Code examples](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/samples/tutorial/Python-and-Oracle-Database-Scripting-for-the-Future.html) and free workshops such as the introductory [Python and Oracle for Developers Workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3482) and a full-stack development workshop using [Python with SQLAlchemy to Oracle Database](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=911&clear=180&session=16650643444916) are available.

You can use many Python frameworks and [object-relational mappers (ORMs)](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html) with Oracle Database. ORMs abstract the tables and objects in a relational database to objects that Python developers can manipulate and operate on. [SQLAlchemy](/sqlalchemy.html) and Django are popular ORMs.  SQLAlchemy is used by Pandas, which is very popular with Oracle users.
The table below shows the relationship between web framework, ORM, driver, and the Oracle Database.

[Python ORMs on that dedicated topic page](/object-relational-mappers-orms.html).

ORMs provide a familiar programming model for Python developers, but sometimes you want that extra performance and operate closer to SQL objects. Oracle cx_Oracle offers several [functions](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/samples/tutorial/Python-and-Oracle-Database-Scripting-for-the-Future.html#binding) to deliver that performance. These functions include fetching data, binding data, executing PL/SQL, operating on LOBs, JSON documents, message passing with Oracle Advanced Queuing, and more.


## Oracle and Data Safety
According to Gartner, Oracle has one of the [highest data safety ratings](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/cloud-database-management-systems/vendor/oracle/product/oracle-database) in the industry, with a wide range of features for data protection and high availability. These features include:

*	[Database encryption](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/advanced-security.html)

*	[Access control to rows](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/label-security.html) in a table

*	[Database vault](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/db-vault.html) to restrict privileges and access

*	[Data redaction, subsetting, and masking](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/data-masking-subsetting.html)

*	All in one data security service in the Oracle Cloud with [Data Safe](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/data-safe.html)

*	Oracle also provides free tools such as the [Database Assessment Tool (DBSAT)](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/dbsat.html) to help you identify and remedy potential vulnerabilities.

Oracle also provides numerous data recovery features, including:

*	Backup capabilities with [RMAN](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/high-availability/rman.html)

*	Restore point features with [Database Flashback](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/high-availability/flashback.html)

*	[Application continuity](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/high-availability/app-continuity.html) in the event of database failover to a standby
