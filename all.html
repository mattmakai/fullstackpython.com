                      <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>You're knee deep in learning the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
programming language. The syntax is starting to make sense. The first
few "<em>ahh-ha</em>!" moments are hitting you as you're learning conditional
statements, for loops and classes while playing around with the open source 
libraries that make Python such an amazing language.</p>
<p>Now you want to take your initial Python knowledge and make something real.
A real web application that's available on the web which you can show off or 
sell as a service to other people. That's where Full Stack Python comes in. 
You've come to the right place to learn everything you need to deploy and 
run a production Python web application.</p>
<p>This guide branches out on topic because your learning needs depend on what
you're currently trying to do. </p>
<h3>Let's get started. What do you need to do right now?</h3>
                      <h1>Web frameworks</h1>
<p>A web application framework is a code library that makes a developer's life
easier when building reliable, scalable and maintainable web applications.</p>
<h2>Why are web frameworks necessary?</h2>
<p>Web frameworks encapsulate what developers have learned over the past twenty
years while building dynamic web applications. Frameworks make it easier
to reuse code for common HTTP operations and to structure your code so that 
it is maintainable.</p>
<h2>Common web framework functionality</h2>
<p>Frameworks provide functionality in their code or through extensions to 
perform common operations required to run web applications. These common 
operations include:</p>
<ol>
<li>URL routing</li>
<li>HTML, XML, JSON, and other output format templating</li>
<li>Database manipulation</li>
<li>Security against Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and other attacks</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all web frameworks include code for all of the above 
functionality. Frameworks fall somewhere between simply executing a 
single use case and attempting to be everything to every developer with
increased complexity. Some frameworks take the "batteries-included" approach 
where everything possible comes bundled with the framework while others 
have a minimal code library that plays well with extensions.</p>
<p>For example, the Django web application framework includes an 
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer that abstracts relational database 
read, write, query, and delete operations. However, Django's ORM
cannot work without significant modification on non-relational databases such as 
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>.
Some other web frameworks such as Flask and Pyramid are easier to
use with non-relational databases by incorporating external Python libraries.
There is a spectrum between minimal functionality with easy extensibility and
including everything in the framework with tight integration.</p>

<h2>Web frameworks learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Choose a major Python web framework (<a href="/django.html">Django</a> or 
<a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> are recommended) and stick with it. When you're just
starting it's best to learn one framework first instead of bouncing around
trying to understand every framework. </p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Work through a detailed tutorial found within the resources links on the
framework's page.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Study open source examples built with your framework of choice so you can 
take parts of those projects and reuse the code in your application.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Build the first simple iteration of your web application then go to
the <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> section to make it accessible on the 
web.</p>
<h3>Which web framework do you want to learn about?</h3>
                      <h1>Django</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is a widely used Python web 
application framework with a "batteries-included" philosophy. The principle
behind batteries-included is that the common functionality for building
web applications should come with the framework instead of as separate
libraries. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" style="border: none;"><img src="theme/img/django-logo-positive.png" width="100%" alt="Official Django logo. Trademark Django Software Foundation." class="technical-diagram" /></a></p>
<p>For example, 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/">authentication</a>,
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/">URL routing</a>, a 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/">templating system</a>,
an <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/">object-relational mapper</a>,
and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/">database schema migrations</a>
(as of version 1.7) are all included with the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.6.2">Django framework</a>. 
Compare that included functionality to the Flask framework which requires a 
separate library such as 
<a href="https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Flask-Login</a>
to perform user authentication. </p>
<p>The batteries-included and extensibility philosophies are simply two different 
ways to tackle framework building.  Neither philosophy is inherently better 
than the other.</p>
<h2>Why is Django a good web framework choice?</h2>
<p>The Django project's stability, performance and community have grown 
tremendously over the past decade since the framework's creation. Detailed
tutorials and best practices are readily available on the web and in books.
The framework continues to add significant new functionality such as 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/">database migrations</a>
with each release. </p>
<p>I highly recommend the Django framework as a starting place for new Python web 
developers because the official documentation and tutorials are some of the 
best anywhere in software development. Many cities also have Django-specific
groups such as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/django-district/">Django District</a>,
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/">Django Boston</a> and 
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-San-Francisco-Django-Meetup-Group/">San Francisco Django</a> 
so new developers can get help when they are stuck.</p>
<p>There's some debate on whether 
<a href="http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/12/11/learning-python-via-django-considered-harmful/">learning Python by using Django is a bad idea</a>. 
However, that criticism is invalid if you take the time to learn the Python
syntax and language semantics first before diving into web development.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Django ORM resources</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/">Django ORM</a> works well
for simple and medium-complexity database operations. However, there are often
complaints that the ORM makes complex queries much more complicated than
writing straight SQL or using <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>. </p>
<p>It's technically possible to drop down to SQL but it ties the queries to a 
specific database implementation. The ORM is coupled closely with Django so
replacing the default ORM with SQLAlchemy is currently a hack workaround. Note
though that some of the Django core committers believe it is only a matter of
time before the default ORM is replaced with SQLAlchemy. It will be a large
effort to get that working though so it's likely to come in Django 1.9 or 
later.</p>
<p>Since the majority of Django projects are tied to the default ORM, it's best to
read up on advanced use cases and tools for doing your best work within the
existing framework.</p>

<h3>What do you need to learn next for your Django app?</h3>
                      <h1>Flask</h1>
<p><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> is a Python web framework built with a 
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/design/">small core and easy-to-extend philosophy</a>. 
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" style="border: none;"><img src="theme/img/flask.png" width="100%" alt="Official Flask logo. Flask Artwork License." class="technical-diagram" /></a></p>
<h2>Why is Flask a good web framework choice?</h2>
<p>Flask is considered more 
<a href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html">Pythonic</a>
than Django because Flask web application code is in most cases more explicit. 
Flask is easy to get started with as a beginner because there is little 
boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running. </p>
<p>For example, here's a valid "hello world" web application with Flask (the
equivalent in Django would be significantly more code):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">from</span> <span class="n">flask</span> <span class="n">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span>
<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="err">@</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sc">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="n">Hello</span> <span class="n">World</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="err">&#39;</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="n">__main__</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="n">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Flask was also written several years after Django and therefore
learned from the Python community's reactions as the framework evolved.
Jökull Sólberg wrote a great piece articulating to this effect in his 
<a href="http://jokull.calepin.co/my-flask-to-django-experience.html">experience switching between Flask and Django</a>.</p>
<h2>Flask resources</h2>
<p>The 18-part Flask mega tutorial is an absolutely amazing starting 
resource for using the Flask framework. Yes, there are a lot of posts in 
the series. However, each post is focused on a single topic to contain 
the complexity while the reader is learning the framework. The whole 
series is well worth an in-depth read-through. The 
<a href="https://twitter.com/miguelgrinberg">author</a> is also wrote the new
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031116.do">O'Reilly Flask Web Development</a>

 and received some interesting responses from other users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other frameworks learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Read through the web frameworks listed above and check out their project
websites. </p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
It's useful to know what other web frameworks exist besides Django and Flask.
However, when you're just starting to learn to program there are significantly 
more tutorials and resources for <a href="/django.html">Django</a> and 
<a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> on the web. My recommendation is to start with one of
those two frameworks then expand your knowledge from there.</p>
<h3>What do you need to learn next?</h3>
                      <h1>Deployment</h1>
<p>Deployment involves packaging up your web application and putting it in a 
production environment that can run the app.</p>
<h2>Why is deployment necessary?</h2>
<p>Your web application must live somewhere other than your own desktop or 
laptop. A production environment is the canonical version of your current 
application and its associated data.</p>
<h2>Deployment topics map</h2>
<p>Python web application deployments are comprised of many pieces that need to
be individually configured. Here is a map that visually depicts how each
deployment topic relates to each other. Click the image to pull up a PDF 
version.</p>
<p><a href="/full-stack-python-map.pdf" target="_blank" style="border: none;"><img src="theme/img/full-stack-python-map.png" width="100%" alt="Full Stack Python site map." class="technical-diagram" /></a></p>
<h2>Deployment hosting options</h2>
<p>There are four options for deploying and hosting a web application:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">"Bare metal" servers</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">Virtualized servers</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">Infrastructure-as-a-service</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/platform-as-a-service.html">Platform-as-a-service</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three options are similar. The deployer needs to provision one or
more servers with a Linux distribution. System packages, a web server, 
WSGI server, database and the Python environment are then installed. Finally
the application can be pulled from source and installed in the environment.</p>
<p>Note that there are other ways of installing a Python web application through
system-specific package management systems. We won't cover those in this
guide as they are considered advanced deployment techniques.</p>
<h2>Deployment resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
If you're tight on time look at the 
<a href="/platform-as-a-service.html">platform-as-a-service (PaaS)</a> options. You can
deploy a low traffic project web app for free or low cost. You won't have to
worry about setting up the operating system and web server compared to going
the traditional server route. In theory you should be able to get your 
application live on the web sooner with PaaS hosting.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
<a href="/servers.html">Traditional server options</a> are your best bet for learning
how the entire Python web stack works. You'll often save money with a virtual
private server instead of a platform-as-a-service as you scale up.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Read about servers, <a href="/operating-systems.html">operating systems</a>, 
<a href="/web-servers.html">web servers</a> and <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a> to get
a broad picture of what components need to be set up to run a Python web 
application.</p>
<h3>How would you like to deploy your web app?</h3>
                      <h1>Servers</h1>
<p>Servers are the physical infrastructure to run all the layers of software
so your web application can respond to requests from clients such as web 
browsers.</p>
<h2>Why are servers necessary?</h2>
<p>Your web application must live somewhere other than your own desktop or 
laptop. Servers should ideally be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
with no unplanned downtime. The servers that host your web application for
actual users (as opposed to test users) are known as <em>production</em> servers.
Production servers hold real data (again as opposed to test data) and must be 
secure against unauthorized access.</p>
<h2>"Bare metal" servers</h2>
<p>The term <em>bare metal</em> refers to purchasing the actual hardware and hooking 
it up to the Internet either through a business-class internet service 
provider (ISP) or 
<a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/colocation/a/what_colocation.htm">co-locating the server</a>
with other servers. A "business-class" ISP is necessary because
most residential Internet service agreements explicitly prohibit running
web servers on their networks. You may be able to get away with low traffic
volume but if your site serves a lot of traffic it will alert an ISP's
filters.</p>
<p>The bare metal option offers the most control over the server configuration,
usually has the highest performance for the price, but also is the most 
expensive upfront option and the highest ongoing maintenance. With bare
metal servers the ongoing operating cost is the electricity the server(s) 
use as well as handling repairs when server components malfunction. You're
taking on manual labor working with hardware as well as the rest of the
software stack.</p>
<p>Buy actual hardware from a vendor either pre-built or as a collection of 
components that you assemble yourself. You can also buy 
pre-configured servers from Dell or HP. Those servers tend to be in
smaller case form factors (called "blades") but are correspondingly more 
expensive than putting off-the-shelf components together yourself in a 
standard computer case.</p>
<h2>Virtualized servers</h2>
<p>Virtual private servers (VPSs) are slices of hardware on top of a larger
bare metal server. Virtualization software such as 
<a href="http://www.xen.org/">Xen</a> and
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/virtualization/what-is-virtualization.html">VMWare</a>
allow providers such as <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and
<a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">prgmr</a> (as well as a many others) to provide
fractions of a full server that appear as their own instances. For example,
a server with an 8-core Xeon processor and 16 gigabytes of memory can be
sliced into 8 pieces with the equivalent of 1-core and 2 gigabytes of
memory.</p>
<p>The primary disadvantage of virtualized servers is that there is resource
overhead in the virtualization process. In addition, physical constraints
such as heavy I/O operations by a single virtualized instance on persistent 
storage can cause performance bottlenecks for other virtualized instances on
the shared server. Choosing virtualized server hosting should be based on
your needs for urgency of service ticket requests and the frequency you
require for ongoing maintenance such as persistent storage backups.</p>
<h3>Virtualized servers resources</h3>
<ul>

  providers.</p>

<p>This post covers hosting types and host to

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Infrastructure-as-a-service</h2>
<p>Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) overlaps with virtualized servers 
because the resources are often presented in the same way. The 
difference between virtualized servers and IaaS is the granularity of the
billing cycle. IaaS generally encourages a finer granularity based on minutes
or hours of server usage instead of on monthly billing cycles.</p>
<p>IaaS can be used in combination with virtualized servers to provide 
dynamic upscaling for heavy traffic. When traffic is low then virtualized
servers can solely be used. This combination of resources reduces cost at
the expense of greater complexity in the dynamically scaled infrastructure. </p>
<p>The most common IaaS platforms are 
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and 
<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to IaaS platforms is the lock-in if you have to write
custom code to deploy, dynamically scale, and generally understand your
infrastructure. Every platform has its quirks. For example, 
Amazon's standard <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">Elastic Block Store</a> storage
infrastructure has at least an order of magnitude worse I/O throughput 
than working with your local disk. Your application's database queries may 
work great locally but then when you deploy the performance is inadequate.
Amazon has <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/07/31/announcing-provisioned-iops-for-amazon-ebs/">higher throughput EBS instances</a>
but you will pay correspondingly more for them. EBS throughput is just 
one of many quirks you need to understand before committing to an 
IaaS platform.</p>

<h2>Servers learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Sign up for a hosting provider. I recommend getting a 
<a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=bfeecaf55a83cd3dd224a5f2a3a001fdf95d4c3d">Linode VPS</a> 
to set up your initial infrastructure and deploy your web application there.
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> and 
<a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">prgrmr</a> are other VPS options. You can change
hosting providers later after the deployment process is automated.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Provision your first server. It will be ready but in a shutdown state while
awaiting your instructions.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Move to the <a href="/operating-systems.html">operating systems</a> section to learn 
how to load Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as a base OS for Python web applications.</p>
<h3>Keep going with setting up a server or try a PaaS?</h3>
                      <h1>Platform-as-a-service</h1>
<p>A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provides infrastructure and a software layer
on which a web application is deployed. Running your web application from
a PaaS removes the need to know as much about the underlying servers, 
operating system, web server, and often the WSGI server. </p>
<p><em>Note</em>: If you are not interested in deploying to a PaaS you can move 
ahead to the <a href="../wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a> section.</p>
<p>The PaaS layer defines how the application accesses resources such as 
computing time, files, and external services. The PaaS provides a 
higher-level abstraction for working with computing resources than deploying 
an application to a server or IaaS.</p>
<p>A PaaS makes deployment and operations easier because it forces the developer
to conform applications to the PaaS architecture. For example, Heroku looks 
for Python's requirements.txt file in the base directory of the repository 
during deployment because that is the file's de facto community standard
location.</p>
<p><img src="theme/img/servers-versus-paas.png" width="100%" alt="Traditional LAMP server stack versus a Platform-as-a-Service stack" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>If you go the PaaS route, you can skip configuring an operating system
and web server prebaked into PaaS offerings. PaaS offerings generally start 
at the WSGI server layer. </p>
<h2>Platform-as-a-service responsibilities</h2>
<p>Although PaaS offerings simplify setting up and maintaining the servers,
operating system, and web server, developers still have responsibilities for other
layers of their web stack.</p>
<p>While it's useful to know the operating system that underpins your PaaS, for 
example Heroku uses Ubuntu 10.04, you will not have to know as much about 
securing the operating system and server level. However, web applications deployed
to a PaaS are just as vulnerable to security breaches at the application level
as a standard LAMP stack. It's still your responsibility to ensure the web
application framework and your app itself is up to date and secured. See the
<a href="../web-application-security.html">security section</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>Platform-as-a-service learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Review the potential Python platform-as-a-service options above and on their
websites.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Sign up for a PaaS account at the provider that appears to best fit your
application needs. Heroku is the PaaS option recommended for starters due to
their detailed documentation and walkthroughs available on the web. However,
the other options are perfectly viable since their purpose is to make deploying
applications as easy as possible.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Check if there are any PaaS-specific configuration files needed for your app
to run properly on the PaaS after it is deployed.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Deploy your app to the PaaS. </p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Sync your application's configuration with the database.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Set up a content delivery network for your application's 
<a href="/static-content.html">static content</a> unless your PaaS provider already
handles this deployment step for you.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Check if the application's functionality is working and tweak as necessary.</p>
<h3>Do you want to use a PaaS or deploy to a traditional server?</h3>
                      <h1>Operating Systems</h1>
<p>An operating system runs on the server or virtual server and controls access 
to computing resources. The operating system also includes a way to install
programs necessary for running your Python web application.</p>
<h2>Why are operating systems necessary?</h2>
<p>An operating system makes many of the computing tasks we take for granted easy.
For example, the operating system enables writing to files, 
communicating over a network and running multiple programs at once. 
Otherwise you'd need to control the CPU, memory, network, graphics card, 
and many other components with your own low-level implementation.</p>
<p>Without using an existing operating system like Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows,
you'd be forced to write a new operating system as part of your web 
application.  It would be impossible to write features for your Python 
web application because you'd be too busy hunting down a memory leak in 
your assembly code, if you even were able to get that far.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the open source community provides Linux to the Python world 
as a rock solid free operating system for running our applications.</p>
<h2>Recommended operating systems</h2>
<p>The only recommended operating system for production Python web stack 
deployments is Linux. There are several Linux distributions commonly used 
for running production servers. Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases, 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and CentOS are all viable options. </p>
<p>Mac OS X is fine for development activities. Windows and Mac 
OS X are not appropriate for production deployments unless there is a 
major reason why you must use them in lieu of Linux.</p>
<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution packaged by the 
<a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical Ltd</a> company. Ubuntu uses the
Debian distribution as a base for packages, including the 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Apt">aptitude package manager</a>. For desktop versions 
of Ubuntu, GNOME (until the 11.04 release) or Unity (11.10 through current)
is bundled with the distribution to provide a user interface.</p>
<p>Ubuntu <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS">Long Term Support</a> (LTS) releases
are the recommended versions to use for deployments. LTS versions receive
five years of post-release updates from Canonical. Every two years, Canonical 
creates a new LTS release, which allows for an easy upgrade path as well 
as flexibility in skipping every other LTS release if necessary. As of
November 2014, 
<a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/">14.04 Trusty Tahr</a>
is the latest Ubuntu LTS release.</p>
<h4>Ubuntu Python Packages</h4>
<p>There are several 
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/aptitude.html">Aptitude</a>
packages found on Linux servers running a Python stack. These packages are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/python-dev">python-dev</a> for header
  files and static library for Python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/python-virtualenv">python-virtualenv</a>
  for creating and managing Python 
  <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenvs</a> to isolate library
  dependencies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Red Hat and CentOS</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>
(RHEL) and <a href="http://www.centos.org/">Community ENTerprise Operating System</a>
(CentOS) are the same distribution. The primary difference between the two 
is that CentOS is an open source, liberally licensed free derivative of RHEL.</p>
<p>RHEL and CentOS use a different package manager and command-line interface 
from Debian-based Linux distributions: RPM Package Manager (RPM) and the 
Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM). RPM has a specific .rpm file format
to handle the packaging and installation of libraries and applications. YUM
provides a command-line interface for interacting with the RPM system.</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Harden the security through a few basic steps. Install basic security 
packages such as <a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">fail2ban</a> 
or its equivalent. Create a new user account with sudo privileges and disable
root logins. Disable password-only logins and use a public-private keypair

<h3>What topic do you need to learn to keep going?</h3>
                      <h1>Web servers</h1>
<p>Web servers respond to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a> (HTTP)
requests from clients and send back a response containing a status code and
often content such as HTML, XML or JSON as well.</p>
<h2>Why are web servers necessary?</h2>
<p>Web servers are the ying to the web client's yang. The server and client speak
the standardized language of the World Wide Web. This standard language
is why an old Mozilla Netscape browser can still talk to a modern Apache or
Nginx web server, even if it cannot properly render the page design like a 
modern web browser can. </p>
<p>The basic language of the Web with the request and response cycle from 
client to server then server back to client remains the same as it was when
the Web was invented by 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> at CERN in 1989.
Modern browsers and web servers have simply extended the language of the Web
to incorporate new standards.</p>
<h2>Client requests</h2>
<p>A client that sends a request to a web server is usually a browser such 
as Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome, but it can also be a</p>
<ul>
<li>headless browser, commonly use for testing, such as 
  <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantomjs</a></li>
<li>commandline utility, for example <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>
  and <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a></li>
<li>text-based web browser such as 
  <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a></li>
<li>web crawler. </li>
</ul>
<p>Web server process requests from the above clients. The result of the web
server's processing is a 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Response_codes">response code</a>
and commonly a content response. Some status codes, such as 204 (No content) 
and 403 (Forbidden), do not have content responses.</p>
<p>In a simple case, the client will request a static asset such as a picture
or JavaScript file. The file sits on the file system in a location the
web server is authorized to access and the web server sends the file
to the client with a 200 status code. If the client already requested the
file and the file has not changed, the web server will pass back a 304 
"Not modified" response indicating the client already has the latest version
of that file.</p>
<p><img src="theme/img/web-browser-server-requests.png" width="100%" class="technical-diagram" alt="Web server and web browser request-response cycle" /></p>
<p>A web server sends files to a web browser based on the web browser's 
request. In the first request, the browser accessed the 
"www.fullstackpython.com"
address and the server responded with the index.html HTML-formatted file. 
That HTML file contained references to other files, such as style.css and 
script.js that the browser then requested from the server.</p>
<p>Sending static assets (such as CSS and JavaScript files) can eat up a 
large amount of bandwidth which is why using a Content Delivery Network 
(CDN) is important when possible (see the content delivery network 
section for a more detailed explanation).</p>

<h2>Web servers learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Choose a web server. <a href="http://nginx.org/en/">Nginx</a> is recommended although 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> is also a great choice.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Create an SSL certificate. For testing use a self-signed certificate and for a
production app buy one from <a href="http://www.digicert.com/">Digicert</a>. Configure 
the web server to serve traffic over SSL. You'll need SSL for serving only
HTTPS traffic and preventing security issues that occur with unencrypted user 
input.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Configure the web server to serve up static files such as CSS, JavaScript
and images.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Once you set up the <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI server</a> you'll need to configure
the web server as a pass through for dynamic content.</p>
<h3>What do you want to learn after the web server is set up?</h3>
                      <h1>WSGI Servers</h1>
<p>A <a href="http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Web Server Gateway Interface</a>
(WSGI) server implements the web server side of the WSGI interface for
running Python web applications. </p>
<h2>Why is WSGI necessary?</h2>
<p>A traditional web server does not understand or have any way to run Python 
applications. In the late 1990s, a developer named Grisha Trubetskoy 
<a href="http://grisha.org/blog/2013/10/25/mod-python-the-long-story/">came up with an Apache module called mod_python</a> 
to execute arbitrary Python code. For several years in the late 1990s 
and early 2000s, Apache configured with mod_python ran most Python web 
applications.</p>
<p>However, mod_python wasn't a standard specification. It was just an 
implementation that allowed Python code to run on a server. As mod_python's 
development stalled and security vulnerabilities were discovered there 
was recognition by the community that a consistent way to execute Python 
code for web applications was needed.</p>
<p>Therefore the Python community came up with WSGI as a standard interface that
modules and containers could implement. WSGI is now the accepted approach 
for running Python web applications.</p>
<p><img src="theme/img/wsgi-interface.png" alt="WSGI server invoking a WSGI application." width="100%" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>As shown in the above diagram, a WSGI server simply invokes a callable object
on the WSGI application as defined by the PEP 3333 standard.</p>
<h2>WSGI's Purpose</h2>
<p>Why use WSGI and not just point a web server directly at an application?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>WSGI gives you flexibility</strong>. Application developers can swap out
  web stack components for others. For example, a developer can switch from 
  Green Unicorn to uWSGI without modifying the application or framework 
  that implements WSGI. 
  From <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP 3333</a>:</p>
<p>The availability and widespread use of such an API in web servers for 
Python [...] would separate choice of framework from choice of web 
server, freeing users to choose a pairing that suits them, while 
freeing framework and server developers to focus on their preferred 
area of specialization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WSGI servers promote scaling</strong>. Serving thousands of requests for dynamic
  content at once is the domain of WSGI servers, not frameworks.
  WSGI servers handle processing requests from the web server and deciding
  how to communicate those requests to an application framework's process.
  The segregation of responsibilities is important for efficiently scaling 
  web traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="theme/img/web-browser-server-wsgi.png" alt="WSGI Server <-> Web server &lt;-&gt; Browser" width="100%" class="technical-diagram" /&gt;</p>
<p>WSGI is by design a simple standard interface for running Python code. As
a web developer you won't need to know much more than</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>what WSGI stands for (Web Server Gateway Inteface)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that a WSGI container is a separate running process that runs on a
  different port than your web server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your web server is configured to pass requests to the WSGI container which
  runs your web application, then pass the response (in the form of HTML)
  back to the requester</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're using a standard web framework such as Django, Flask, or
Bottle, or almost any other current Python framework, you don't need to worry
about how frameworks implement the application side of the WSGI standard.
Likewise, if you're using a standard WSGI container such as Green Unicorn,
uWSGI, mod_wsgi, or gevent, you can get them running without worrying about
how they implement the WSGI standard.</p>
<p>However, knowing the WSGI standard and how these frameworks and containers
implement WSGI should be on your learning checklist though as you become
a more experienced Python web developer.</p>
<h2>Official WSGI specifications</h2>
<p>The WSGI standard v1.0 is specified in
<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">PEP 0333</a>. As of September 2010,
WSGI v1.0 is superseded by
<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP 3333</a>, which defines the
v1.0.1 WSGI standard. If you're working with Python 2.x and you're compliant
with PEP 0333, then you're also compliant with 3333. The newer version is
simply an update for Python 3 and has instructions for how unicode should
be handled.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/wsgiref.html">wsgiref in Python 2.x</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/wsgiref.html">wsgiref in Python 3.x</a>
are the reference implementations of the WSGI specification built into
Python's standard library so it can be used to build WSGI servers and
applications.</p>
<h2>Example web server configuration</h2>
<p>A web server's configuration specifies what requests should be passed to
the WSGI server to process. Once a request is processed and generated by the
WSGI server, the response is passed back through the web server and onto
the browser. </p>
<p>For example, this Nginx web server's configuration specifics
Nginx should handle static assets (such as images, JavaScript, and CSS
files) under the /static directory and pass all other requests to the WSGI
server running on port 8000:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="cp"># this specifies that there is a WSGI server running on port 8000</span>
<span class="n">upstream</span> <span class="n">app_server_djangoapp</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">server</span> <span class="n">localhost</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">8000</span> <span class="n">fail_timeout</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

<h2>WSGI servers learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Understand that WSGI is a standard Python specification for applications and 
servers to implement. </p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Pick a WSGI server based on available documentation and tutorials. Green 
Unicorn is a good one to start with since it's been around for awhile.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Add the WSGI server to your server deployment.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Configure the web server to pass requests to the WSGI server for appropriate
URL patterns.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Test that the WSGI server responds to local requests but not direct requests 
outside your infrastructure. The web server should be the pass through for
requests to and responses from the WSGI server.</p>
<h3>What's next after your Python code is running?</h3>
                      <h1>Source control</h1>
<p>Source control, also known as <em>version control</em>, stores software code files
with a detailed history of every modification made to those files.</p>
<h2>Why is source control necessary?</h2>
<p>Version control systems allow developers to modify code without worrying 
about permanently screwing something up. Unwanted changes can be easily rolled
back to previous working versions of the code. </p>
<p>Source control also makes team software development easier. One developer 
can combine her code modifications with other developers' code through 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> views that show line-by-line 
changes then merge the appropriate code into the main code branch.</p>
<p>Version control is a necessity on all software projects regardless of 
development time, codebase size or the programming language used. Every
project should immediately begin by using a version control system such
as Git or Mercurial.</p>
<h2>Source control during deployment</h2>
<p>Pulling code during a deployment is a potential way source control systems fit
into the deployment process. </p>
<p><img src="theme/img/app-source-control.png" width="100%" class="technical-diagram" alt="App deployment uses a server to pull from the source control system."></p>
<p>Note that some developers recommend deployment pipelines package the source 
code to deploy it and never have a production environment touch a source 
control system directly. However, for small scale deployments it's often
easiest to pull from source code when you're getting started instead of 
figuring out how to wrap the Python code in a system installation package.</p>
<h2>Source control projects</h2>
<p>Numerous source control systems have been created over the past several
decades. In the past, proprietary source control software offered features
tailored to large development teams and specific project workflows. However,
open source systems are now used for version control on the largest and most
complicated software projects in existence. There's no reason why your project
should use anything other than an open source version control system in
today's Python development world. The two primary choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a free and open source distributed version
  control system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> is similar to Git, also a free
  and open source distributed version control system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hosted source control services</h2>
<p>Git and Mercurial can be downloaded and run on your own server. However,
it's easy and cheap to get started with a hosted version control service.
You can transition away from the service at a later time by moving your 
repositories if your needs change. A couple of recommended hosted version
control services are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is currently the most commonly used source
  control platform for using Git.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> provides free Git and Mercurial 
  repositories for open projects and private repositories for up to five
  users. Users pay for hosting private repositories with more than five users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>General source control resources</h2>

<h2>Source control learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Pick a version control system. Git is recommended because on the web there 
are a significant number of tutorials to help both new and advanced users.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Learn basic use cases for version control such as committing changes, rolling 
back to earlier file versions and searching for when lines of code were 
modified during development history.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Ensure your source code is backed up in a central repository. A central
repository is critical not only if your local development version is corrupted
but also for the deployment process.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Integrate source control into your deployment process in three ways. First,
pull the project source code from version control during deployments. Second, 
kick off deployments when code is modified by using webhooks or polling on 
the repository. Third, ensure you can roll back to a previous version if a 
code deployment goes wrong.</p>
<h3>Now that your source code is versioned, what's next?</h3>
                      <h1>Application Dependencies</h1>
<p>Application dependencies are the libraries other than your project code
that are required to create and run your application. </p>
<h2>Why are application dependencies important?</h2>
<p>Python web applications are built upon the work done by thousands of open
source programmers. Application dependencies include not only web frameworks but
also libraries for scraping, parsing, processing, analyzing, visualizing, 
and many other tasks. Python's ecosystem facilitates discovery, retrieval and 
installation so applications are easier for developers to create.</p>
<h2>Finding libraries</h2>
<p>Python libraries are stored in a central location known as the 
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">Python Package Index</a> (PyPi). PyPi contains
search functionality with results weighted by usage and relevance based on
keyword terms.</p>
<p>Besides PyPi there are numerous resources that list common or "must-have" 
libraries. Ultimately the decision for which application dependencies are
necessary for your project is up to you and the functionality you're looking
to build. However, it's useful to browse through these lists in case you come 
across a library to solve a problem by reusing the code instead of writing it
all yourself. A few of the best collections of Python libraries are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules">Python.org's useful modules</a>
  which groups modules into categories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/trending?l=python">GitHub Explore Trending repositories</a>
  shows the open source Python projects trending today, this week, and this 
  month.</p>

<p>This list of <a href="http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/20-python-libraries-you-cant-live-without/">20 Python libraries you can’t live without</a>
  is a wide-ranging collection from data analysis to testing tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wikipedia actually has an extensive 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software">page dedicated to Python libraries</a> 
  grouped by categories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Isolating dependencies</h2>
<p>Dependencies are installed separately from system-level packages to prevent 
library version conflicts. The most common isolation method is 
<a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>. Each virtualenv is its
own copy of the Python interpreter and depedencies in the site-packages
directory. To use a virtualenv it must first be created with the virtualenv
command and then activated.</p>
<p>The virtualenv stores dependencies in an isolated environment. The web 
application then relies only on that virtualenv instance which has a separate
copy of the Python interpreter and site-packages directory. A high level of
how a server configured with virtualenv can look is shown in the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="theme/img/server-setup.png" alt="How the virtualenv separates dependencies on the server." width="100%" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>Installing Python dependencies</h2>
<p>The recommended way to install Python library dependencies is with the 
<a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/">pip</a> command when a virtualenv
is activated.</p>
<p>Pip and virtualenv work together and have complementary responsibilities.
Pip downloads and installs application dependencies from the central
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPi</a> repository. </p>
<h2>requirements.txt</h2>
<p>The pip convention for specifying application dependencies is with a 
<a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/1.4.1/cookbook.html#requirements-files">requirements.txt</a>
file. When you build a Python web application you should include a 
requirements.txt file. </p>
<p>Python projects' dependencies for a web application should be specified in the
requirements.txt with 
<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-pip">pegged dependencies</a> like
the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">django</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">1.6</span>
<span class="n">bpython</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">0.12</span>
<span class="n">django</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">braces</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">0.2.1</span>
<span class="n">django</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">utils</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">1.1.0</span>
<span class="n">logutils</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">0.3.3</span>
<span class="n">South</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">0.7.6</span>
<span class="n">requests</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">1.2.0</span>
<span class="n">stripe</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">1.9.1</span>
<span class="n">dj</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">database</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">0.2.1</span>
<span class="n">django</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">oauth2</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">provider</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">0.2.4</span>
<span class="n">djangorestframework</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mf">2.3.1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Pegged dependencies with precise version numbers or Git tags are important 
because otherwise the latest version of a dependency will be used. While
it may sound good to stay up to date, there's no telling if your application
actually works with the latest versions of all dependencies. Developers should 
deliberately upgrade and test to make sure there were no backwards-incompatible
modifications in newer dependency library versions.</p>
<h2>setup.py</h2>
<p>There is another type of dependency specification for Python libraries
known as 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1471994/what-is-setup-py">setup.py</a>.
Setup.py is a standard for distributing and installing Python libraries.
If you're building a Python library, such as 
<a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/makaimc/underwear">underwear</a> you must include setup.py
so a dependency manager can correctly install both the library as well as
additional dependencies for the library. There's still quite a bit of 
confusion in the Python community over the difference between 
requirements.txt and setup.py, so read this 
<a href="https://caremad.io/blog/setup-vs-requirement/">well written post</a> for
further clarification.</p>

<h2>Application dependencies learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Ensure the libraries your web application depends on are all captured in a
requirement.txt file with pegged versions. </p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
An easy way to capture currently installed dependencies is with the 
<code>pip freeze</code> command.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Create a fresh virtualenv and install the dependencies from your 
requirements.txt file by using the <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> 
command.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Check that your application runs properly with the fresh virtualenv and only
the installed dependencies from the requirements.txt file.</p>
<h3>What do you need to learn after installing your app dependencies?</h3>
                      <h1>Databases</h1>
<p>A database is an abstraction on top of an operating system's file system to 
ease creating, reading, updating, and deleting persistent data. </p>
<h2>Why are databases necessary?</h2>
<p>At a high level web applications store data and present it to users in a 
useful way. For example, Google stores data about roads and provides 
directions to get from one location to another by driving through the 
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Maps</a> application. Driving directions are 
possible because the data is stored in a structured way. </p>
<p>Databases make structured storage reliable and fast. They also give you a 
mental framework for how the data should be saved and retrieved instead of 
having to figure out what to do with the data every time you build a new 
application.</p>
<h2>Relational databases</h2>
<p>The database storage abstraction most commonly used in Python web development 
is sets of relational tables. Alternative storage abstractions are explained 
in the <a href="../no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL</a> section of this guide.</p>
<p>Relational databases store all data in a series of tables. Interconnections
between the tables are specified as <em>foreign keys</em>.</p>
<p>Databases storage implementations vary in complexity. SQLite, a database 
included with Python, creates a single file for all data per database. 
Other databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL have more complicated
persistence schemes while offering additional advanced features that are 
useful for web application data storage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and 
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> are two of the most common open source
databases for storing Python web application data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> is a database that is stored in a single
file on disk. SQLite is built into Python but is only built for access
by a single connection at a time. Therefore is highly recommended to not
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/databases/#database-is-locked-errors">run a production web application with SQLite</a>.</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL is the recommended relational database for working with Python
web applications. PostgreSQL's feature set, active development and stability
contribute to its usage as the backend for millions of applications live
on the Web today.</p>

<h2>MySQL</h2>
<p>MySQL is another viable open source database backend option for Python web 
applications. MySQL has a slightly easier initial learning curve than 
PostgreSQL. The database is deployed in production at some of the highest 
trafficked sites such as 
<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/mysql-twitter">Twitter</a>, 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/mysql-and-database-engineering-mark-callaghan/10150599729938920">Facebook</a>
and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/customers/">many others major organizations</a>.
However, since the company focused on MySQL development, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB">MySQL AB</a>, was 
purchased by Sun Microsystems (which was in turn purchased by Oracle), there
have been major defections away from the database by
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/wikipedia-moving-from-mysql-to-mariadb-7000008912/">Wikipedia</a> 
and <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/14/google-waves-goodbye-to-mysql-in-favor-of-mariadb">Google</a>. 
MySQL remains a viable database option but I always recommend new Python 
developers learn PostgreSQL if they do not already know MySQL.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Connecting to a database with Python</h2>
<p>To work with a relational database using Python, you need to use a code 
library. The most common libraries for relational databases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a> for PostgreSQL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.4">MySQLdb</a> for MySQL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/">cx_Oracle</a> for Oracle</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SQLite support is built into Python 2.7+ and therefore a separate library
is not necessary. Simply "import sqlite3" to begin interfacing with the 
single file-based database.</p>
<h2>Object-Relational Mapping</h2>
<p>Object-relational mappers (ORMs) allow developers to access data from a 
backend by writing Python code instead of SQL queries. Each web 
application framework handles integrating ORMs differently. </p>
<p>Django provides an ORM with its core functionality. Flask leaves using an 
ORM up to an extension, such as 
<a href="http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/">Flask-SQLALchemy</a>. </p>
<p>Developers can also use ORMs without a web framework, such as when
creating a data analysis tool or a batch script without a user interface. 
Currently, the most widely used stand-alone ORM written for Python is
<a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the differences between SQLAlchemy and the Django
ORM I highly recommend reading 
<a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/7/19/sqlachemy-and-you/">SQLAlchemy and You</a>

<h2>Database third-party services</h2>
<p>Numerous companies run scalable database servers as a hosted service.
Hosted databases can often provide automated backups and recovery,
tightened security configurations and easy vertical scaling, depending on the
provider.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>
  provides pre-configured MySQL and PostgreSQL instances. The instances can
  be scaled to larger or smaller configurations based on storage and performance
  needs.</p>

<h2>Databases learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Install PostgreSQL on your server. Assuming you went with Ubuntu run 
<code>sudo apt-get install postgresql</code>.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Make sure the <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a> library is part of your
application dependencies.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Configure your web application to connect to the PostgreSQL instance.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Create models in your ORM, either with Django's 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/">built-in ORM</a> or
<a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy with Flask</a>. </p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Sync the ORM models with the PostgreSQL instance.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Start creating, reading, updating and deleting data in the database from your 
web application.</p>
<h3>What's next to get your app running?</h3>
                      <h1>NoSQL Data Stores</h1>
<p>Relational databases store the vast majority of web application 
persistent data. However, there are several alternative classifications of 
storage representations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Key-value pair</li>
<li>Document-oriented</li>
<li>Column-family table</li>
<li>Graph</li>
</ol>
<p>These persistent data storage representations are commonly used to augment,
rather than completely replace, relational databases.</p>
<h2>Key-value Pair</h2>
<p>Key-value pair data stores are based
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash map</a> data structures.</p>
<h3>Key-value pair data stores</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> is an open source in-memory key-value pair data 
  store. Redis is often called "the Swiss Army Knife of web application
  development." It can be used for caching, queuing, and storing session data 
  for faster access than a traditional relational database, among many other
  use cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key-value pair resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-redis">How To Install and Use Redis</a>"

  a detailed look behind the scenes with a massive Redis deployment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Document-oriented</h2>
<p>A document-oriented database provides a semi-structured representation for
nested data. </p>
<h3>Document-oriented data stores</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> is an open source document-oriented 
  data store with a Binary Object Notation (BSON) storage format that is 
  JSON-style and familiar to web developers.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.optinidus.com/blogs/guide-to-mongodb-for-startups/">MongoDB for startups</a> 
  is a guide about using non-relational databases in green field environments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Column-family table</h2>
<p>A the column-family table class of NoSQL data stores builds on the key-value
pair type. Each key-value pair is considered a row in the store while the
column family is similar to a table in the relational database model.</p>
<h3>Column-family table data stores</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apache <a href="https://hbase.apache.org/">HBase</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apache <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Graph</h2>
<p>A graph database represents and stores data in three aspects: nodes, edges,
and properties. </p>
<p>A <em>node</em> is an entity, such as a person or business. </p>
<p>An <em>edge</em> is the relationship between two entities. For example, an 
edge could represent that a node for a person entity is an employee of a 
business entity. </p>
<p>A <em>property</em> represents information about nodes. For example, an entity 
representing a person could have a property of "female" or "male".</p>
<h3>Graph data stores</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> is one of the most widely used graph 
  databases and runs on the Java Virtual Machine stack.</p>

<h2>NoSQL data stores learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Understand why NoSQL data stores are better for some use cases than relational
databases. In general these benefits are only seen at large scale so they may
not be applicable to your web application.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Integrate Redis into your project for a speed boost over slower persistent 
storage. Storing session data in memory is generally much faster than saving
that data in a traditional relational database that uses persistent storage. 
Note that when memory is flushed the data goes away so anything that needs to
be persistent must still be backed up to disk on a regular basis.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Evaluate other use cases such as storing transient logs in document-oriented
data stores such as MongoDB.</p>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
                      <h1>Web Design</h1>
<p>Web design is the creation of a web application's style and user interaction
using CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Why is web design important?</h2>
<p>You don't really expect users to use your 2014 web application if it looks
like this, do you?</p>
<p><img src="theme/img/no-style-webpage.png" width="100%" alt="HTML with no CSS or JavaScript." class="technical-diagram" /> </p>
<p>Creating web pages with their own style and interactivity so users can easily
accomplish their tasks is a major part of building modern web applications.</p>
<h2>Responsive design</h2>
<p>Separating the content from the rules for how to display the content allows 
devices to render the output differently based on factors such as screen size
and device type. Displaying content differently based on varying screen 
attributes is often called <em>responsive design</em>. The responsiveness is 
accomplished by implementing
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries">media queries</a>
in the <a href="/cascading-style-sheets.html">CSS</a>. </p>
<p>For example, a mobile device does not have as much space to display a 
navigation bar on the side of a page so it is often pushed down 
below the main content. The 
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/">Bootstrap Blog example</a> 
shows that navigation bar relocation scenario when you resize the browser 
width.</p>
<h2>Design resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://bootstrappingdesign.com/">Bootstrapping Design</a> book is one of 
  the clearest and concise resources for learning design that I've ever read. 
  Highly recommended especially if you feel you have no design skills but 
  need to learn them.</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">Kuler</a> is a complementary
  color picker by Adobe that helps choose colors for your designs.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about how browsers work behind the scenes, 
  here's a 
  <a href="http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html">blog post series on building a browser engine</a>
  that will show you how to build a simple rendering engine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
                      <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files contain rules for how to display and 
lay out the HTML content when it is rendered by a web browser.</p>
<h2>Why is CSS necessary?</h2>
<p>CSS separates the content contained in HTML files from how the content 
should be displayed. It is important to separate the content from the rules
for how it should be rendered primarily because it is easier to reuse those
rules across many pages. CSS files are also much easier to maintain on large
projects than styles embedded within the HTML files.</p>
<h2>How is CSS retrieved from a web server?</h2>
<p>The HTML file sent by the web server contains a reference to the CSS file(s)
needed to render the content. The web browser requests the CSS file after the
HTML file as shown below in a screenshot captured of the Chrome Web Developer 
Tools network traffic.</p>
<p><img src="theme/img/css-chrome-dev-tools.jpg" width="100%" alt="Google Chrome Web Developer Tools shows how CSS is separate from the HTML content." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>That request for the fsp.css file is made because the HTML file for Full 
Stack Python contains a reference to <code>theme/css/fsp.css</code> which is shown
in the view source screenshot below.</p>
<p><img src="theme/img/fsp-css-source.jpg" width="100%" alt="View source screenshot for the fsp.css file in index.html." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>CSS preprocessors</h2>
<p>A CSS preprocessor compiles a processed language into plain CSS code. CSS 
preprocessing languages add syntax such as variables, mixins and functions
to reduce code duplication. The additional syntax also makes it possible for
designers to use these basic programming constructs to write maintainable
front end code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is currently the favored preprocessor in
  the design community. Sass is considered the most powerful CSS preprocessor
  in terms of advanced language features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> is right up there with Sass and has an ace up
  its sleeve in that the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Framework</a> is
  written in LESS which brings up its popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/">Stylus</a> is often cited as the third
  most popular CSS preprocessing language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>CSS preprocessor resources</h3>

<h2>CSS learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Create a simple HTML file with basic elements in it. Use the
<code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> command to serve it up. Create a 
<code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> element within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section in the HTML page. 
Start playing with CSS within that style element to change the look and feel 
of the page.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Check out front end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation and integrate
one of those into the HTML page.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Work through the framework's grid system, styling options and customization
so you get comfortable with how to use the framework.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Apply the framework to your web application and tweak the design until you
have something that looks much better than generic HTML.</p>
<h3>Once your app is styled what do you need to learn next?</h3>
                      <h1>JavaScript</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a small scripting programming language embedded in web browsers 
to enable dynamic content and interaction. </p>
<h2>Why is JavaScript necessary?</h2>
<p>JavaScript executes in the client and enables dynamic content and interaction
that is not possible with HTML and CSS alone. Every modern Python web 
application uses JavaScript on the front end. </p>
<h2>Front end frameworks</h2>
<p>Front end JavaScript frameworks move the rendering for most of a web 
application to the client side. Often these applications are informally 
referred to as "one page apps" because the webpage is not reloaded upon every
click to a new URL. Instead, partial HTML pages are loaded into the 
document object model or data is retrieved through an API call then displayed
on the existing page.</p>
<p>Examples of these front end frameworks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Front end frameworks are rapidly evolving. Over the next several years 
consensus about good practices for using the frameworks will emerge.</p>
<h2>How did JavaScript originate?</h2>
<p>JavaScript is an implementation of 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/JavaScript_Overview">the ECMAScript specification</a> 
which is defined by the 
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm">Ecma International Standards Body</a>.</p>
<h2>JavaScript resources</h2>

                      <h1>Continuous Integration</h1>
<p>Continuous integration (CI) automates building, testing and deploying 
applications.</p>
<h2>Why is continuous integration important?</h2>
<p>When CI is set up well it can dramatically reduce deployment times by 
eliminating manual steps and ensure code does not have bugs that are being
checked by automated tests. Source code changes as a project evolves.
CI combined with unit and integration tests check that code modifications 
do not break existing tests ensure the software works as intended.</p>

                      <h1>Code Metrics</h1>
<p>Code metrics can be produced by static code analysis tools to determine 
complexity and non-standard practices.</p>
<h2>Why are code metrics important?</h2>
<p>Code metrics allow developers to find problematic codebase areas that may
need refactoring. In addition, some metrics such as technical debt assist 
developers in communicating to non-technical audiences why issues with a
system are occurring.</p>

                      <h1>Configuration Management</h1>
<p>Configuration management involves modifying servers from an existing state to 
a desired state and automating how an application is deployed.</p>
<h2>Configuration management tools</h2>
<p>Numerous tools exist to modify server state in a controlled 
way, including <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet">Puppet</a>, 
<a href="http://www.getchef.com/chef/">Chef</a>, 
<a href="http://www.saltstack.com/">SaltStack</a>, and Ansible. Puppet and Chef are
written in Ruby, while SaltStack and Ansible are written in Python.</p>
<h2>Ad hoc tasks</h2>
<p>Configuration management tools such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack
are not useful for performing ad hoc tasks that require interactive responses.
<a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.8/">Fabric</a> and 
<a href="http://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/latest/">Invoke</a> are used for interactive 
operations, such as querying the database from the Django manage.py shell.</p>

<h2>Application dependencies learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Learn about configuration management in the context of deployment automation
and infrastructure-as-code.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Pick a configuration management tool and stick with it. My recommendation is
Ansible because it is by far the easiest tool to learn and be productive with.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Read your configuration management tool's documentation and, when necessary,
the source code.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Automate the configuration management and deployment for your project. Note
that this is by far the most time consuming step in this checklist but will
pay dividends every time you deploy your project.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Hook the automated deployment tool into your existing deployment process.</p>
<h3>What's next after automating your app configuration?</h3>
                      <h1>Static content</h1>
<p>Some content on a website does not change and therefore should be served
up either directly through the web server or a content delivery network (CDN).
Examples include JavaScript, image, and CSS files.</p>
<h2>Types of static content</h2>
<p>Static content can be either assets created as part of your development
process such as images on your landing page or user-generated content. The 
Django framework calls these two categories <em>assets</em> and <em>media</em>.</p>
<h2>Content delivery networks</h2>
<p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a third party that stores and serves 
static files. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a>,
<a href="http://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/files/">Rackspace Cloud Files</a> 
are examples of CDNs. The purpose of a CDN is to remove the load of static
file requests from web servers that are handling dynamic web content. For
example, if you have an nginx server that handles both static files and 
acts as a front for a Green Unicorn WSGI server on a 512 megabyte 
virtual private server, the nginx server will run into resource 
constraints under heavy traffic. A CDN can remove the need to serve static
assets from that nginx server so it can purely act as a pass through for 
requests to the Green Unicorn WSGI server.</p>
<p>CDNs send content responses from data centers with the closest proximity to the requester.</p>
<h2>Static Content Resources</h2>

a Django library for managing static and media files on services such as

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Static content learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Identify a content delivery network to offload serving static content files
from your local web server. I recommend using Amazon S3 with CloudFront as 
it's easy to set up and will scale to high bandwidth demands.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Update your web application deployment process so updated static files are
uploaded to the CDN. </p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Move static content serving from the www subdomain to a static (or similarly
named) subdomain so browsers will load static content in parallel to www
HTTP requests.</p>
<h3>What's next for building your app?</h3>
                      <h1>Caching</h1>
<p>Caching can reduce the load on servers by storing the results of common 
operations and serving the precomputed answers to clients. </p>
<p>For example, instead of retrieving data from database tables that rarely 
change, you can store the values in-memory. Retrieving values from an 
in-memory location is far faster than retrieving them from a database (which
stores them on a persistent disk like a hard drive.) When the cached values 
change the system can invalidate the cache and re-retrieve the updated values
for future requests.</p>
<p>A cache can be created for multiple layers of the stack. </p>
<h2>Caching backends</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://memcached.org/">memcached</a> is a common in-memory caching system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> is a key-value in-memory data store that can
  easily be configured for caching with libraries such as 
  <a href="https://github.com/sebleier/django-redis-cache">django-redis-cache</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Caching resources</h2>
<ul>

<p>"<a href="https://bjornjohansen.no/caching-varnish-or-nginx">Caching: Varnish or Nginx?</a>"

  reverse proxy Nginx or Varnish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://bizcoder.com/caching-is-hard-draw-me-a-picture">Caching is Hard, Draw me a Picture</a>
  has diagrams of how web request caching layers work. The post is relevant
  reading even though the author is describing his Microsoft code as the 
  impetus for writing the content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caching learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Analyze your web application for the slowest parts. It's likely there are
complex database queries that can be precomputed and stored in an in-memory
data store.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Leverage your existing in-memory data store already used for session data
to cache the results of those complex database queries. 
A <a href="/task-queues.html">task queue</a> can often be used to precompute the results 
on a regular basis and save them in the data store.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Incorporate a cache invalidation scheme so the precomputed results remain 
accurate when served up to the user.</p>
<h3>What do you want to learn now that your app is responding faster?</h3>
                      <h1>Task queues</h1>
<p>Task queues manage background work that must be executed outside the usual
HTTP request-response cycle.</p>
<h2>Why are task queues necessary?</h2>
<p>Tasks are handled asynchronously either because they are not initiated by 
an HTTP request or because they are long-running jobs that would dramatically
reduce the performance of an HTTP response.</p>
<p>For example, a web application could poll the GitHub API every 10 minutes to
collect the names of the top 100 starred repositories. A task queue would
handle invoking code to call the GitHub API, process the results and store them
in a persistent database for later use.</p>
<p>Another example is when a database query would take too long during the HTTP
request-response cycle. The query could be performed in the background on a
fixed interval with the results stored in the database. When an
HTTP request comes in that needs those results a query would simply fetch the
precalculated result instead of re-executing the longer query.
This precalculation scenario is a form of <a href="/caching.html">caching</a> enabled 
by task queues.</p>
<p>Other types of jobs for task queues include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>spreading out large numbers of independent database inserts over time 
  instead of inserting everything at once</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aggregating collected data values on a fixed interval, such as every
  15 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scheduling periodic jobs such as batch processes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task queue projects</h2>
<p>The defacto standard Python task queue is Celery. The other task queue 
projects that arise tend to come from the perspective that Celery is overly
complicated for simple use cases. My recommendation is to put the effort into
Celery's reasonable learning curve as it is worth the time it takes to 
understand how to use the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> distributed task queue is the
  most commonly used Python library for handling asynchronous tasks and 
  scheduling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://python-rq.org/">RQ (Redis Queue)</a> is a simple Python
  library for queueing jobs and processing them in the background with workers.
  RQ is backed by Redis and is designed to have a low barrier to entry.

<h2>Task queue learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> 
Pick a slow function in your project that is called during an HTTP request.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>

                      <h1>Application Programming Interfaces</h1>
<p>Application programming interfaces (APIs) provide machine-readable
data transfer and signaling between applications.</p>
<h2>Why are APIs important?</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript create human-readable webpages. However, those 
webpages are not easily consumable by other machines.</p>
<p>Numerous scraping programs and libraries exist to rip data out of HTML but 
it's simpler to consume data through APIs. For example, if you want the
content of a news article it's easier to get the content through an API than
to scrap the text out of the HTML.</p>
<h2>Key API concepts</h2>
<p>There are several key concepts that get thrown around in the APIs world. It's
best to understand these ideas first before diving into the API literature.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Representation State Transfer (REST)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Webhooks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Extensible Markup Language (XML)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endpoints</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Webhooks</h2>
<p>A webhook is a user-defined HTTP callback to a URL that executes when a 
system condition is met. The call alerts the second system via a POST or GET
request and often passes data as well.</p>
<p>Webhooks are important because they enable two-way communication initiation 
for APIs. Webhook flexibility comes in from their definition by the API user
instead of the API itself.</p>
<p>For example, in the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/api">Twilio API</a> when a text 
message is sent to a Twilio phone number Twilio sends an HTTP POST request 
webhook to the URL specified by the user. The URL is defined in a text box
on the number's page on Twilio as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="theme/img/twilio-webhook-definition.jpg" width="100%" alt="Webhook definition in the Twilio API." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>API open source projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger</a> is an open source project 
  written in Scala that defines a standard interface for RESTful APIs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>API resources</h2>

<h3>What's next after learning about APIs?</h3>
                      <h1>API Integration</h1>
<p>The majority of production Python web applications rely on several
externally hosted application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs are also
commonly referred to as third party services or external platforms. 
Examples include <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> for messaging and voice
services, <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for payment processing, and
<a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> for embedded webpage comments.</p>
<p>There are many articles about proper API design but best practices for 
integrating APIs is less commonly written about. However, this subject 
continuously grows in importance because APIs provide critical functionality
across many implementation areas.</p>
<h2>Hosted API testing services</h2>

<h2>API integration learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Pick an API known for top notch documentation. Here's a list of 
<a href="https://medium.com/she-hacks-hacker-academy/4d3c43be9386">ten APIs that are a good starting point for beginners</a>.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Read the API documentation for your chosen API. Figure out a simple use case
for how your application could be improved by using that API.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Before you start writing any code, play around with the API through the 
commandline with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> or in the browser with 
<a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>. This exercise will help you get a
better understanding of API authentication and the data required for requests
and responses.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Evaluate whether to use a helper library or work with 
<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a>. Helper libraries are
usually easier to get started with while Requests gives you more control over
the HTTP calls.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Move your API calls into a <a href="/task-queues.html">task queue</a> so they do not 
block the HTTP request-response cycle for your web application.</p>

<h2>API creation learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Pick an API framework appropriate for your web framework. For Django I 
recommend Django REST framework and for Flask I recommend Flask-RESTful.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Begin by building out a simple use case for the API. Generally the use case
will either involve data that users want in a machine-readable format or a
backend for alternative clients such as an iOS or Android mobile app.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Add an authentication mechanism through OAuth or a token scheme.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Add rate limiting to the API if data usage volume could be a performance issue.
Also add basic metrics so you can determine how often the API is being 
accessed and whether it is performing properly.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Provide ample documentation and a walkthrough for how the API can be accessed
and used.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Figure out other use cases and expand based on what you learned with the 
initial API use case.</p>
<h3>What's next after building an API for your web app?</h3>
                      <h1>Logging</h1>
<p>Logging saves output such as errors, warnings and event information to 
files for debugging purposes. </p>
<h2>Why is logging important?</h2>
<p>Runtime exceptions that prevent code from running are important to log to 
investigate and fix the source of the problems. Informational and debugging 
logging also helps to understand how the application is performing even if 
code is working as intended.</p>
<h2>Logging levels</h2>
<p>Logging is often grouped into several categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information</li>
<li>Debug</li>
<li>Warning</li>
<li>Error</li>
</ol>
<p>Logging errors that occur while a web framework is running is crucial to
understanding how your application is performing. </p>
<h2>Logging aggregators</h2>
<p>When you are running your application on several servers, it is helpful
to have a monitoring tool called a "logging aggregator". You can configure 
your application to forward your system and application logs to one location 
that provides tools for viewing, searching, and monitoring logging events 
across your cluster. </p>
<p>Another advantage of log aggregatortion tools is they allow you to set up 
custom alerts and alarms so you can get notified when error rates breach a 
certain threshold.</p>
<h3>Open source log aggregators</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry">Sentry</a> started as a Django-only
  exception handling service but now has separate logging clients to cover 
  almost all major languages and frameworks. It still works really well for 
  Python-powered web applications and is often used in conjunction with other 
  monitoring tools. <a href="http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Raven</a> is open
  source Python client for Sentry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://graylog2.org/">Graylog2</a> provides a central server for log 
  aggregation as well as a GUI for browsing and searching through log events. 
  There are libraries for most major languages, including python. Saves data 
  in Elasticache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://logstash.net/">Logstash</a> Similar to Graylog2, logstash offers 
  features to programatically configure log data workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/facebook/scribe">Scribe</a> A project written by Facebook 
  to aggregate logs. It's designed to run on multiple servers and scale with 
  the rest of your cluster. Uses the Thrift messaging format so it can be 
  used with any language. </p>

<h2>Logging learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Read how to integrate logging into your web application framework. </p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Ensure errors and anomalous results are logged. While these logs can be stored 
in <a href="/monitoring.html">monitoring</a> solutions, it's best to have your own log
storage location to debug issues as they arise to complement other monitoring 
systems.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Integrate logging for system events you may need to use for debugging purposes
later. For example, you may want to know the return values on functions when
they are above a certain threshold. </p>
<h3>Logging isn't enough. How do I analyze more data about the app?</h3>
                      <h1>Monitoring</h1>
<p>Monitoring tools capture, analyze and display information for a web 
application's execution. Every application has issues arise throughout
all levels of the web stack. Monitoring tools provide transparency so
developers and operations teams can respond and fix problems.</p>
<h2>Why is monitoring necessary?</h2>
<p>Capturing and analyzing data about your production environment is critical
to proactively deal with stability, performance, and errors in a web 
application.</p>
<h2>Difference between monitoring and logging</h2>
<p>Monitoring and logging are very similar in their purpose of helping to 
diagnose issues with an application and aid the debugging process. One way
to think about the difference is that logging happens based on explicit events
while monitoring is a passive background collection of data. </p>
<p>For example, when an error occurs, that event is explicitly logged through
code in an exception handler. Meanwhile, a monitoring agent instruments the
code and gathers data not only about the logged exception but also the 
performance of the functions.</p>
<p>This distinction between logging and monitoring is vague and not necessarily
the only way to look at it. Pragmatically, both are useful for maintaining a
production web application.</p>
<h2>Monitoring layers</h2>
<p>There are several important resources to monitor on the operating system 
and network level of a web stack.</p>
<ol>
<li>CPU utilization</li>
<li>Memory utilization</li>
<li>Persistence storage consumed versus free</li>
<li>Network bandwidth and latency</li>
</ol>
<p>Application level monitoring encompasses several aspects. The amount of time
and resources dedicated to each aspect will vary based on whether an 
application is read-heavy, write-heavy, or subject to rapid swings in traffic.</p>
<ol>
<li>Application warnings and errors (500-level HTTP errors)</li>
<li>Application code performance</li>
<li>Template rendering time</li>
<li>Browser rendering time for the application</li>
<li>Database querying performance</li>
</ol>

<h2>Monitoring learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Review the software-as-a-service and open source monitoring tools below. Third
party services tend to be easier to set up and host the data for you. Open
source projects give you more control but you'll need to have additional 
servers ready for the monitoring.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
My recommendation is to install <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>'s free 
option with the trial period to see how it works with your app. It'll give you
a good idea of the capabilities for application-level monitoring tools.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
As your app scales take a look at setting up one of the the open source 
monitoring projects such as StatsD with Graphite. The combination of those
two projects will give you fine-grained control over the system metrics 
you're collecting and visualizing.</p>
<h3>What topic do you want to learn next?</h3>
                      <h1>Web analytics</h1>
<p>Web analytics involves collecting, processing, visualizing web data to enable
critical thinking about how users interact with a web application.</p>
<h2>Why is web analytics important?</h2>
<p>User clients, especially web browsers, generate significant data while users
read and interact with webpages. The data provides insight into 
how visitors use the site and why they stay or leave. The key concept to
analytics is <em>learning</em> about your users so you can improve your web 
application to better suit their needs. </p>
<h2>Web analytics concepts</h2>
<p>It's easy to get overwhelmed at both the number of analytics services and
the numerous types of data points collected. Focus on just a handful of
metrics when you're just starting out. As your application scales and you 
understand more about your users add additional analytics services 
to gain further insight into their behavior with advanced visualizations such
as heatmaps and action funnels. The
<a href="http://spenczar.com/posts/2013/Sep/07/seven-stages-analytics-grief/">seven stages of startup analytics grief</a> 
post is an amusing read and provides context for how to begin and then grow 
tracked metrics over time.</p>
<h3>User funnels</h3>
<p>If your application is
selling a product or service you can ultimately build a 
<a href="http://moz.com/blog/building-your-marketing-funnel-with-google-analytics">user funnel</a> (often called "sales funnel" prior to a user becoming a customer)
to better understand why people buy or don't buy what you're selling. With
a funnel you can visualize drop-off points where visitors leave your 
application before taking some action, such as purchasing your service.</p>
<h2>Open source web analytics projects</h2>

<h2>Web analytics learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Add Google Analytics or Piwik to your application. Both are free and while 
Piwik is not as powerful as Google Analytics you can self-host the application
which is the only option in many environments.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Think critically about the factors that will make your application successful.
These factors will vary based on whether it's an internal enterprise app, 
an e-commerce site or an information-based application.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Add metrics generated from your web traffic based on the factors that drive
your application's success. You can add these metrics with either some custom
code or with a hosted web analytics service.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Continuously reevaluate whether the metrics you've chosen are still the 
appropriate ones defining your application's success. Improve and refine the
metrics generated by the web analytics as necessary.</p>
<h3>What's the next topic you want to learn about?</h3>
                      <h1>Web Application Security</h1>
<p>Website security must be thought about while building every level of the web

treatment, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, cross-site 
request forgery and usage of public-private keypairs.</p>

<h2>Web security learning checklist</h2>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Read and understand the major web application security flaws that are
commonly exploited by malicious actors. These include cross-site request 
forgery (CSRF), cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection and session 
hijacking. The 
<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10">OWASP top 10 web application vulnerabilities list</a> 
is a great place to get an overview of these topics.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Determine how the framework you've chosen mitigates these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Ensure your code implements the mitigation techniques for your framework. </p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Think like an attacker and actively work to break into your own system. If
you do not have enough experience to confidently break the security consider
hiring a known white hat attacker. Have her break the application's security,
report the easiest vulnerabilities to exploit in your app and help implement
protections against those weaknesses.</p>
<p><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>
Recognize that no system is ever totally secure. However, the more popular
an application becomes the more attractive a target it is to attackers.
Reevaluate your web application security on a frequent basis.</p>

<h3>Those resources should help get you started. What's next?</h3>
                      <h1>Development Environments</h1>
<p>A development environment is a combination of a text editor and the Python
interpreter. The text editor allows you to write the code. The interpreter
provides a way to execute the code you've written. A text editor can be
as simple as Notepad on Windows or more complicated as a complete integrated
development environment (IDE) such as 
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> which runs on any major 
operating system.</p>
<h2>Why is a development environment necessary?</h2>
<p>Python code needs to be written, executed and tested to build
applications. The text editor provides a way to write the code. The 
interpreter allows it to be executed. Testing to see if the code does what
you want can either be done manually or by unit and functional tests. </p>
<h2>A full development environment example</h2>
<p>Here's what I (the author of Full Stack Python, 
<a href="/about-author.html">Matt Makai</a>) use to develop most of my Python 
applications. I have a Macbook Pro with Mac OS X as its base operating 
system. <a href="/operating-systems.html">Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</a> is virtualized on top 
with <a href="https://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a>. My code is written in 
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and executed with the 
<a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/">Python 2.7.x</a> interpreter
via the command line. I use virtualenv to create separate Python interpreters
with their own isolated
<a href="/application-dependencies.html">application dependencies</a> and
<a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">virtualenvwrapper</a>
to quickly switch between the interpreters created by virtualenv.</p>
<p>That's a common set up but you can certainly write great code with a much
less expensive set up or a cloud-based development environment.</p>
<h2>Open source development environments</h2>

<h2>Hosted development environment services</h2>
<p>In the past couple of years several cloud-based development environments
have popped up. These can work great for when you're learning or stuck on
a machine with only a browser but no way to install your own software. Most
of these have free tiers for getting started and paid tiers as you scale
up your application.</p>

<p>That's the whole history of Full Stack Python. What do you want to learn now?</p>
                      <h1>Future Directions</h1>
<p>Full Stack Python is a larger undertaking than I originally envisioned. My
original intent was to link to the best resources by category. That grew into
explaining the concepts plus including the best links I could find.</p>
<p>This short section lays out my thoughts on what I'm working to improve in the
intermediate-to-long term. Full Stack Python is my main 2014 project so I want 
to make it a comprehensive "complete" reference for Python developers by the
end of the year.</p>
<p>These plans can change based on 
<a href="https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/pulls">pull requests</a>
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day or two so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!</p>
<p>Here are some things I'm actively working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Update these sections with better explanations and resources: </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/configuration-management.html">Configuration management</a></li>
<li><a href="/javascript.html">JavaScript</a></li>
<li><a href="/cascading-style-sheets.html">CSS</a></li>
<li><a href="/api-integration.html">API integration</a></li>
<li><a href="/api-creation.html">API creation</a></li>
<li><a href="/web-application-security.html">Web security</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plain English explanations for Django, Flask and Bottle framework concepts 
  such as how forms work with templates, how models interact with views and
  what the files are when a new boilerplate project is created (especially
  important with Django)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Split web application security and other security (lower level protocols)
  into separate pages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After those updates are done I'll go back through and apply visuals to
each section to make them easier to read and understand.</p>
