# Best Python Resources
The Python community is amazing at sharing detailed resources and helping
beginners learn to program with the language. There are so many resources
out there though that it can be difficult to know how to find them. 

This page aggregates the best general Python resources with descriptions of
what they provide to readers.

## New to programming
If you're learning your first programming language these books were written
with you in mind. Developers learning Python as a second or later language
should skip down to the next section for "experienced developers".

* To get an introduction to Python, Django and Flask at the same time, 
  consider purchasing the 
  <a href="https://realpython.com/?utm_source=fsp&utm_medium=promo&utm_campaign=bestresources">Real Python</a> 
  course by Fletcher, Michael and Jeremy.

* This [short 5 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvK0UzFNw1Q)
  explains why it's better to think of projects you'd like to build and
  problems you want to solve with programming. Start working on those projects
  and problems rather than jumping into a specific language that's recommended
  to you by a friend.

* [CS for All](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall/) is an open book by professors
  at Harvey Mudd College which teaches the fundamentals of computer science
  using Python. It's an accessible read and perfect for programming beginners.

* If you've never programmed before check out the 
  [Getting Started](http://learntocodewith.me/getting-started/) page on 
  [Learn To Code with Me](http://learntocodewith.me/)
  by [Laurence Bradford](https://twitter.com/lebdev). She's done an 
  incredible job of breaking down the steps beginners should take when 
  they're uncertain about where to begin.

* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) is a
  free book by Zed Shaw.

* The [Python projects tag](https://www.twilio.com/blog/tag/python) on the 
  Twilio blog is constantly updated with fun tutorials you can build to
  learn Python, such as the
  [International Space Station Tracker with Flask and Redis-Queue](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/11/international-space-station-notifications-with-python-redis-queue-and-twilio-copilot.html), 
  [Choose Your Own Adventures Presentations using Flask and WebSockets](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations-with-reveal-js-python-and-websockets.html)
  and [Martianify Photos with OpenCV](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/11/getting-started-with-opencv-and-python-featuring-the-martian-2.html).

* [Dive into Python 3](http://www.diveinto.org/python3/) is an open source
  book provided under the Creative Commons license and available in HTML or
  PDF form.

* [A Byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/) is a beginner's
  tutorial for the Python language. 

* Code Academy has a [Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)
  for people completely new to programming.

* [Introduction to Programming with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/index.html)
  goes over the basic syntax and control structures in Python. The free book 
  has numerous code examples to go along with each topic.

* Google put together a great compilation of materials and subjects you 
  should read and learn from if you want to be a 
  [professional programmer](https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html).
  Those resources are useful not only for Python beginners but any developer
  who wants to have a strong professional career in software.

* The O'Reilly book 
  [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html)
  is available in HTML form for free on the web.

* [Python Practice Book](http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/index.html)
  is a book of Python exercises to help you learn the basic language syntax.

* Looking for ideas about what projects to use to learn to code? Check out 
  [this list of 5 programming project for Python beginners](https://medium.com/learning-journalism-tech/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner-21492f6ce0f3).

* There's a Udacity course by one of the creators of Reddit that shows how to 
  [use Python to build a blog](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253).
  It's a great introduction to web development concepts through coding.

* I wrote a quick blog post on
  [learning Python](http://www.mattmakai.com/learning-python-for-non-developers.html)
  that non-technical folks trying to learn to program may find useful.

* [Python for you and me](http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is an
  approachable book with sections for Python syntax and the major language 
  constructs. The book also contains a short guide at the end to get
  programmers to write their first Flask web application.


## Python for specific occupations
Python is powerful for many professions. If you're seeking to use Python in a
specific field, one of these guides may be the most appropriate for you.

* [Python for Social Scientists](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~gawron/python_for_ss/)
  contains a textbook, course outline and slides for a college course that taught
  social scientists to use Python for their profession.

* [Practical Business Python](http://pbpython.com/) is a blog that covers topics
  such as how to automate generating large Excel spreadsheets or perform analysis 
  when your data is locked in Microsoft Office files.

* [Python for the Humanities](http://fbkarsdorp.github.io/python-course/) is a
  textbook and course on the basics of Python and text processing. Note if you've
  never worked with Python before the material ramps up quickly after the first
  chapter so you will likely want to combine it with some other introduction to
  Python resources.

* [Practical Python for Astronomers](https://python4astronomers.github.io/)
  provides open source workshop materials for teaching students studying 
  astronomy to use Python for data analysis.


## Experienced developers new to Python
If you can already program in another language, these resources are better for
getting up to speed because they are more concise when explaining introductory 
topics.

* [Learn Python in y minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)
  provides a whirlwind tour of the Python language. The guide is especially
  useful if you're coming in with previous software development experience
  and want to quickly grasp how the language is structured.

* Developers familiar with other languages often have difficulty adapting to
  accepted Python code style. Make sure to read the 
  [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) code style guidelines
  as well as 
  [The Elements of Python Style](https://github.com/amontalenti/elements-of-python-style)
  to know the Python community standards.

* [How to Develop Quality Python Code](https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/how-to-develop-quality-python-code)
  is a good read to begin learning about development environments, 
  application dependencies and project structure.

* The [Python module of the week](https://pymotw.com/2/contents.html) 
  chapters are a good way to get up to speed with the standard library.
  Doug Hellmann is also now updating the list for changes brought about 
  from the upgrade to Python 3 from 2.x.

* Kenneth Reitz's 
  [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/)
  contains a wealth of information both on the Python programming language and the community.

* [Composing Programs](http://composingprograms.com/) shows how to build 
  compilers with Python 3, which is a good undertaking if you're looking
  to learn both more about the Python language and how compiles work.

* [Good to Great Python Reads](http://jessenoller.com/good-to-great-python-reads/)
  is a collection of intermediate and advanced Python articles around the web
  focused on nuances and details of the Python language itself.


## Videos, screencasts and presentations
Videos from conferences and meetups along with screencasts are listed on
the [best Python videos](/best-python-videos.html) page.


## Curated Python packages lists
* [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) is an incredible
  list of Python frameworks, libraries and software. I wish I had this
  page when I was just getting started. 

* [easy-python](http://easy-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is like
  awesome-python although instead of just a Git repository this site is
  in the Read the Docs format.


## Podcasts
* [Talk Python to Me](http://www.talkpythontome.com/) focuses on the
  people and organizations coding on Python. Each episode features a
  different guest interviewee to talk about his or her work.

* [Podcast.\_\_init\_\_](http://podcastinit.com/) is another podcast on
  "about Python and the people who make it great".


## Newsletters
* [Python Weekly](http://www.pythonweekly.com/) is a free weekly roundup
  of the latest Python articles, videos, projects and upcoming events.

* [PyCoder's Weekly](http://pycoders.com/) is another great free weekly
  email newsletter similar to Python Weekly. The best resources are generally
  covered in both newsletters but they often cover different articles
  and projects from around the web.

* [Import Python](http://importpython.com/newsletter/) is a newer newsletter
  than Python Weekly and PyCoder's Weekly. So far I've found this newsletter
  often pulls from different sources than the other two. It's well worth 
  subscribing to all three so you don't miss anything.

* The [Full Stack Python monthly newsletter](https://www.fullstackpython.com/email.html) 
  is a monthly newsletter that focuses on a single topic each month. For 
  example, one month will aggregate great Flask resources, while another 
  month will provide WSGI server configurations.
