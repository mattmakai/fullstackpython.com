I'm `Matt Makai <http://www.mattmakai.com/>`_ and I solve problems by 
developing software. I often use Python and occasionally work with 
languages in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) stack.

In 2013 I will be traveling to 30 cities in the United States to visit with
tech companies, attend and speak at tech meetups, and blog from an experienced
software developer's perspective about the current state of technology in the
United States. If you're reading this guide then you're likely someone I'm
interested in meeting during my trip.  Send me an email at 
matthew.makai@gmail.com or 
`message me on Twitter <https://twitter.com/makaimc>`_. Read more about
my upcoming trip that will take place between March 9 and August 15, 2013 at 
`Coding Across America <http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/about.html>`_.

If there are typos, inaccurate statements, or general areas for improvement
that you see in this guide, please issue a 
`pull request on this website's Github repository <https://github.com/makaimc/fullstackpython.github.com/pull/new/gh-pages>`_. Thank you!
