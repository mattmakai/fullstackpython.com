# Web Design
Web design is the creation of a web application's style and user interaction
using CSS and JavaScript.


## Why is web design important?
You wouldn’t use a web application that looked like the following screenshot, 
would you?

<img src="/img/no-style-webpage.png" width="100%" alt="HTML with no CSS or JavaScript." class="technical-diagram" /> 

Creating web pages with their own style and interactivity so users can easily
accomplish their tasks is a major part of building modern web applications.


## Responsive design
Separating the content from the rules for how to display the content allows 
devices to render the output differently based on factors such as screen size
and device type. Displaying content differently based on varying screen 
attributes is often called *responsive design*. The responsiveness is 
accomplished by implementing
[media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries)
in the [CSS](/cascading-style-sheets.html). 

For example, a mobile device does not have as much space to display a 
navigation bar on the side of a page so it is often pushed down 
below the main content. The 
[Bootstrap Blog example](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/) 
shows that navigation bar relocation scenario when you resize the browser 
width.
