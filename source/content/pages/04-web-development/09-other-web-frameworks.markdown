meta: Python has dozens of web frameworks with differing philosophies. Learn more about frameworks on Full Stack Python.


# Other Web Frameworks
Python has a significant number of web frameworks outside the usual Django,
Flask, Pyramid and Bottle suspects.


## TurboGears2
[TurboGears2](http://www.turbogears.org) born as a full stack layer on top
of Pylons is now a standalone web framework that can act both as a full stack
solution (like Django) or as a micro framework.


## Falcon
[Falcon](http://falconframework.org/) is a minimalist web framework designed
with web application speed as a top priority.


## web.py
[web.py](http://webpy.org/) is a Python web framework designed for simplicity
in building web applications.

* See this Reddit discussion on 
  [reasons why to not use web.py](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/2sjghv/is_there_any_reason_to_not_use_webpy/)
  for some insight into the state of the project.


## web2py
[Web2py](http://www.web2py.com/) is a batteries-included philosophy framework
with project structure based on model-view-controller patterns.


## CherryPy
[CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/) is billed as a minimalist web framework,
from the perspective of the amount of code needed to write a web application
using the framework. The project has a 
[long history](http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ws-cherrypy/all/all) 
and made a major transition between the second and third release.


## Muffin
[Muffin](https://github.com/klen/muffin) is a web framework
built on top of the [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
module in the Python 3.4+ standard library. Muffin takes inspiration from
Flask with URL routes defined as decorators upon view functions. The 
[Peewee ORM](https://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is used instead of 
the more common SQLAlchemy ORM.


## Other web framework resources
* This [roundup of 14 minimal Python frameworks](http://codecondo.com/14-minimal-web-frameworks-for-python/)
  contains both familiar and less known Python libraries.

* The [web micro-framework battle](http://www.slideshare.net/r1chardj0n3s/web-microframework-battle/)
  presentation goes over Bottle, Flask, and many other lesser known Python
  web frameworks.

* A Python newcomer asked the Python Subreddit to 
 [explain the differences between numerous Python web frameworks](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/28qr7c/can_anyone_explain_the_differences_between_web2py/)
 and received some interesting responses from other users.


## Other frameworks learning checklist
1. Read through the web frameworks listed above and check out their project
   websites. 

1. It's useful to know what other web frameworks exist besides Django and 
   Flask. However, when you're just starting to learn to program there are 
   significantly more tutorials and resources for [Django](/django.html) and 
   [Flask](/flask.html) on the web. My recommendation is to start with one of
   those two frameworks then expand your knowledge from there.
