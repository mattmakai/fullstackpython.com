Full Stack Python began way back in December 2012 when I started writing
the initial [deployment](/deployment.html), [server](/servers.html), 
operating system, web server and WSGI server pages. Since then, the pages
have expanded out into a 
[boatload of other areas](/table-of-contents.html)
including subjects outside the deployment topics I originally started the
site to explain.

Frequently though I wanted to write a Python walkthrough that was not a
good fit for the page format I use for each topic. Many of those walkthroughs
became [Twilio blog posts](https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/mmakai)
but not all of them were quite the right fit on there. I'll still be writing
plenty more Twilio tutorials, but this [Full Stack Python blog](/blog.html)
is the spot for technical posts that fall outside the Twilio domain.

Let me know what you think and what tutorials you'd like to see in the future.
